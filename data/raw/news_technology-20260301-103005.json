      "content_text": "Samsung, with some of its latest updates, is set to remove some core tools from Android’s recovery menu, and it’s unclear why. Every Android smartphone ships with a recovery menu that includes the abilty to reset the device, wipe the cache, apply updates, and more. That’s a very simplified explanation, but it’s a standard feature, and one that you might be most familiar with when manually sideloading Android updates, such as the beta updates Google releases for Pixels. In One UI 8.5, though, Samsung is making a change to this. As first noted by GalaxyClub and spotted by others too, Samsung is removing several options from the Android recovery menu with the latest updates for Galaxy phones. Specifically, the update is removing: Advertisement - scroll for more content Apply update from ADB Apply update from SD card Wipe cache partition View recovery logs Run graphics test Run locale test The only options remaining are “Reboot system now,” “Wipe data/factory reset,” and “Power off.” Image: GalaxyClub 9to5Google can confirm that, at least on the current software build (January 2026 security patch), recovery tools are still fully in place on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, but that could change seeing as GalaxyClub reports seeing this change attached to February 2026 security updates. This change might be permanent, too, as GalaxyClub also notes that this update came with a notice saying that “you will not be able to downgrade to the old software due to changes in security policy.” So why is this happening? Put simply, we do not know. There has been speculation, though, that Samsung might be tightening security. Just today, a leaker showed that Samsung is taking legal action to put a stop to One UI build leaks. It’d certainly be quite a big move for Samsung to just cut off sideloading via the recovery for eveyone in response, but it’s not necessarily out of the question either. The Galaxy S26 series is available for pre-order now, with Samsung’s usual pre-order perks in full swing. You’ll find boosted trade-in values and more available now through March 11, when these phones are available on store shelves.

      "content_text": "Eating mostly oatmeal for just two days may significantly reduce cholesterol, according to a clinical trial from the University of Bonn published in Nature Communications . The study focused on people with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions that includes excess body weight, high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar, and abnormal blood lipid levels. Participants followed a calorie restricted plan made up almost entirely of oatmeal for 48 hours. Compared with a control group that also reduced calories but did not eat oats, those on the oat based plan saw a markedly greater improvement in their cholesterol levels. The reduction remained noticeable even six weeks later. Researchers also found that the diet changed the balance of bacteria in the gut. Substances produced by these microbes appear to play an important role in the health benefits linked to oats. A Historic Diabetes Therapy Revisited Oats have long been associated with metabolic health. In the early 20th century, German physician Carl von Noorden used oats to treat patients with diabetes, reporting strong results. \"Today, effective medications are available to treat patients with diabetes,\" explains Marie-Christine Simon, junior professor at the Institute of Nutritional and Food Science at the University of Bonn. \"As a result, this method has been almost completely overlooked in recent decades.\" The volunteers in the new study did not have diabetes, but they did have metabolic syndrome, which raises the risk of developing the disease. This condition is defined by excess weight, high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar, and disorders of lipid metabolism. \"We wanted to know how a special oat-based diet affects patients,\" says Simon, who is also a member of the Transdisciplinary Research Areas \"Life & Health\" and \"Sustainable Futures\" at the University of Bonn. 300 Grams of Oatmeal Per Day During the intensive phase, participants ate boiled oatmeal three times daily and could only add small amounts of fruit or vegetables. In total, 32 women and men completed the two day oat based intervention. Each person consumed 300 grams of oatmeal per day and cut their usual calorie intake roughly in half. The control group also reduced calories but did not consume oats. Both groups experienced some benefits from eating fewer calories. However, the improvements were stronger among those who ate oats. \"The level of particularly harmful LDL cholesterol fell by 10 percent for them -- that is a substantial reduction, although not entirely comparable to the effect of modern medications,\" stresses Simon. \"They also lost two kilos in weight on average and their blood pressure fell slightly.\" Lowering LDL cholesterol is especially important for heart health. When LDL levels are too high, cholesterol can build up inside artery walls, forming plaques that narrow blood vessels. These plaques may rupture during physical strain, emotional stress, or spikes in blood pressure. A resulting blood clot can completely block blood flow or travel to the heart or brain, triggering a heart attack or stroke. Gut Microbiome Changes May Explain the Effect To understand why oats had this impact, researchers examined the gut microbiome. \"We were able to identify that the consumption of oatmeal increased the number of certain bacteria in the gut,\" says Linda Klümpen, the study's lead author. Scientists increasingly recognize that gut bacteria are central to how the body processes food. These microbes generate metabolic byproducts that nourish intestinal cells and support their normal function. Some of these bacterial products also enter the bloodstream, where they can influence other organs. \"For instance, we were able to show that intestinal bacteria produce phenolic compounds by breaking down the oats,\" says Klümpen. \"It has already been shown in animal studies that one of them, ferulic acid, has a positive effect on the cholesterol metabolism. This also appears to be the case for some of the other bacterial metabolic products.\" At the same time, certain microbes help eliminate the amino acid histidine. Without this process, the body can convert histidine into a compound believed to promote insulin resistance, a hallmark of diabetes mellitus. Short Intensive Plan Outperformed Longer Moderate Intake The cholesterol lowering effects were still visible six weeks after the two day intervention. \"A short-term oat-based diet at regular intervals could be a well-tolerated way to keep the cholesterol level within the normal range and prevent diabetes,\" says Junior Professor Simon. However, the benefits were strongest when oats were consumed in high amounts alongside calorie restriction. In a separate six week phase, participants ate 80 grams of oatmeal per day without additional dietary limits. That approach produced only modest changes. \"As a next step, it can now be clarified whether an intensive oat-based diet repeated every six weeks actually has a permanently preventative effect,\" Simon adds. How the Randomized Controlled Trials Were Conducted A total of 68 people took part in the research. In the two day oat based study, 17 participants in the oat group and 15 in the control group completed the trial. Two individuals in the control group withdrew for personal reasons. In the six week intervention, 17 participants in each group finished the study. The researchers determined the group size of 17 per arm based on earlier interventional data. Both the short and longer interventions were randomized controlled trials. In these \"RCTs,\" participants are assigned at random to different groups. One group receives the intervention being tested, in this case oats, while the control group does not. Ideally, participants are \"blind\" and unaware of which group they are in, which reduces placebo effects. In nutrition studies, full blinding is often difficult because people usually know what they are eating. That was true here. However, the laboratory teams analyzing blood and stool samples were unaware of which group the samples came from. The same applied to blood pressure and weight measurements, reducing the chance that expectations could influence the results. Before any dietary changes, researchers collected blood and stool samples and measured blood pressure, weight, height, waist circumference, and body fat. Follow up assessments took place immediately after the two day oat phase and again at two, four, and six weeks. The same measurements and sample collections were repeated each time. The six week oatmeal group underwent identical testing procedures. Blood samples were analyzed for LDL cholesterol levels and for dihydroferulic acid, a phenolic compound thought to be produced by beneficial gut bacteria. Stool samples were used to identify bacterial species by isolating 16S RNA, a molecule unique to bacteria that varies slightly between species, much like a fingerprint. Researchers also examined which metabolic byproducts were present. The study received funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the German Diabetes Association (DDG), the German Research Foundation (DFG), the German Cereal Processing, Milling and Starch Industries' Association (VGMS), and RASO Naturprodukte.",

      "content_text": "This is a brief guide to my new art project microgpt , a single file of 200 lines of pure Python with no dependencies that trains and inferences a GPT. This file contains the full algorithmic content of what is needed: dataset of documents, tokenizer, autograd engine, a GPT-2-like neural network architecture, the Adam optimizer, training loop, and inference loop. Everything else is just efficiency. I cannot simplify this any further. This script is the culmination of multiple projects (micrograd, makemore, nanogpt, etc.) and a decade-long obsession to simplify LLMs to their bare essentials, and I think it is beautiful 🥹. It even breaks perfectly across 3 columns: Where to find it: The following is my guide on stepping an interested reader through the code. Dataset The fuel of large language models is a stream of text data, optionally separated into a set of documents. In production-grade applications, each document would be an internet web page but for microgpt we use a simpler example of 32,000 names, one per line: # Let there be an input dataset `docs`: list[str] of documents (e.g. a dataset of names) if not os . path . exists ( 'input.txt' ): import urllib.request names_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/makemore/refs/heads/master/names.txt' urllib . request . urlretrieve ( names_url , 'input.txt' ) docs = [ l . strip () for l in open ( 'input.txt' ). read (). strip (). split ( ' \\n ' ) if l . strip ()] # list[str] of documents random . shuffle ( docs ) print ( f \"num docs: { len ( docs ) } \" ) The dataset looks like this. Each name is a document: emma olivia ava isabella sophia charlotte mia amelia harper ... (~32,000 names follow) The goal of the model is to learn the patterns in the data and then generate similar new documents that share the statistical patterns within. As a preview, by the end of the script our model will generate (“hallucinate”!) new, plausible-sounding names. Skipping ahead, we’ll get: sample 1: kamon sample 2: ann sample 3: karai sample 4: jaire sample 5: vialan sample 6: karia sample 7: yeran sample 8: anna sample 9: areli sample 10: kaina sample 11: konna sample 12: keylen sample 13: liole sample 14: alerin sample 15: earan sample 16: lenne sample 17: kana sample 18: lara sample 19: alela sample 20: anton It doesn’t look like much, but from the perspective of a model like ChatGPT, your conversation with it is just a funny looking “document”. When you initialize the document with your prompt, the model’s response from its perspective is just a statistical document completion. Tokenizer Under the hood, neural networks work with numbers, not characters, so we need a way to convert text into a sequence of integer token ids and back. Production tokenizers like tiktoken (used by GPT-4) operate on chunks of characters for efficiency, but the simplest possible tokenizer just assigns one integer to each unique character in the dataset: # Let there be a Tokenizer to translate strings to discrete symbols and back uchars = sorted ( set ( '' . join ( docs ))) # unique characters in the dataset become token ids 0..n-1 BOS = len ( uchars ) # token id for the special Beginning of Sequence (BOS) token vocab_size = len ( uchars ) + 1 # total number of unique tokens, +1 is for BOS print ( f \"vocab size: { vocab_size } \" ) In the code above, we collect all unique characters across the dataset (which are just all the lowercase letters a-z), sort them, and each letter gets an id by its index. Note that the integer values themselves have no meaning at all; each token is just a separate discrete symbol. Instead of 0, 1, 2 they might as well be different emoji. In addition, we create one more special token called BOS (Beginning of Sequence), which acts as a delimiter: it tells the model “a new document starts/ends here”. Later during training, each document gets wrapped with BOS on both sides: [BOS, e, m, m, a, BOS] . The model learns that BOS initates a new name, and that another BOS ends it. Therefore, we have a final vocavulary of 27 (26 possible lowercase characters a-z and +1 for the BOS token). Autograd Training a neural network requires gradients: for each parameter in the model, we need to know “if I nudge this number up a little, does the loss go up or down, and by how much?”. The computation graph has many inputs (the model parameters and the input tokens) but funnels down to a single scalar output: the loss (we’ll define exactly what the loss is below). Backpropagation starts at that single output and works backwards through the graph, computing the gradient of the loss with respect to every input. It relies on the chain rule from calculus. In production, libraries like PyTorch handle this automatically. Here, we implement it from scratch in a single class called Value : class Value : __slots__ = ( 'data' , 'grad' , '_children' , '_local_grads' ) def __init__ ( self , data , children = (), local_grads = ()): self . data = data # scalar value of this node calculated during forward pass self . grad = 0 # derivative of the loss w.r.t. this node, calculated in backward pass self . _children = children # children of this node in the computation graph self . _local_grads = local_grads # local derivative of this node w.r.t. its children def __add__ ( self , other ): other = other if isinstance ( other , Value ) else Value ( other ) return Value ( self . data + other . data , ( self , other ), ( 1 , 1 )) def __mul__ ( self , other ): other = other if isinstance ( other , Value ) else Value ( other ) return Value ( self . data * other . data , ( self , other ), ( other . data , self . data )) def __pow__ ( self , other ): return Value ( self . data ** other , ( self ,), ( other * self . data ** ( other - 1 ),)) def log ( self ): return Value ( math . log ( self . data ), ( self ,), ( 1 / self . data ,)) def exp ( self ): return Value ( math . exp ( self . data ), ( self ,), ( math . exp ( self . data ),)) def relu ( self ): return Value ( max ( 0 , self . data ), ( self ,), ( float ( self . data > 0 ),)) def __neg__ ( self ): return self * - 1 def __radd__ ( self , other ): return self + other def __sub__ ( self , other ): return self + ( - other ) def __rsub__ ( self , other ): return other + ( - self ) def __rmul__ ( self , other ): return self * other def __truediv__ ( self , other ): return self * other **- 1 def __rtruediv__ ( self , other ): return other * self **- 1 def backward ( self ): topo = [] visited = set () def build_topo ( v ): if v not in visited : visited . add ( v ) for child in v . _children : build_topo ( child ) topo . append ( v ) build_topo ( self ) self . grad = 1 for v in reversed ( topo ): for child , local_grad in zip ( v . _children , v . _local_grads ): child . grad += local_grad * v . grad I realize that this is the most mathematically and algorithmically intense part and I have a 2.5 hour video on it: micrograd video . Briefly, a Value wraps a single scalar number ( .data ) and tracks how it was computed. Think of each operation as a little lego block: it takes some inputs, produces an output (the forward pass), and it knows how its output would change with respect to each of its inputs (the local gradient). That’s all the information autograd needs from each block. Everything else is just the chain rule, stringing the blocks together. Every time you do math with Value objects (add, multiply, etc.), the result is a new Value that remembers its inputs ( _children ) and the local derivative of that operation ( _local_grads ). For example, __mul__ records that \\(\\frac{\\partial(a \\cdot b)}{\\partial a} = b\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial(a \\cdot b)}{\\partial b} = a\\). The full set of lego blocks: Operation Forward Local gradients a + b \\(a + b\\) \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} = 1, \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial b} = 1\\) a * b \\(a \\cdot b\\) \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} = b, \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial b} = a\\) a ** n \\(a^n\\) \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} = n \\cdot a^{n-1}\\) log(a) \\(\\ln(a)\\) \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} = \\frac{1}{a}\\) exp(a) \\(e^a\\) \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} = e^a\\) relu(a) \\(\\max(0, a)\\) \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} = \\mathbf{1}_{a > 0}\\) The backward() method walks this graph in reverse topological order (starting from the loss, ending at the parameters), applying the chain rule at each step. If the loss is \\(L\\) and a node \\(v\\) has a child \\(c\\) with local gradient \\(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial c}\\), then: \\[\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial c} \\mathrel{+}= \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial c} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v}\\] This looks a bit scary if you’re not comfortable with your calculus, but this is literally just multiplying two numbers in an intuitive way. One way to see it looks as follows: “If a car travels twice as fast as a bicycle and the bicycle is four times as fast as a walking man, then the car travels 2 x 4 = 8 times as fast as the man.” The chain rule is the same idea: you multiply the rates of change along the path. We kick things off by setting self.grad = 1 at the loss node, because \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial L} = 1\\): the loss’s rate of change with respect to itself is trivially 1. From there, the chain rule just multiplies local gradients along every path back to the parameters. Note the += (accumulation, not assignment). When a value is used in multiple places in the graph (i.e. the graph branches), gradients flow back along each branch independently and must be summed. This is a consequence of the multivariable chain rule: if \\(c\\) contributes to \\(L\\) through multiple paths, the total derivative is the sum of contributions from each path. After backward() completes, every Value in the graph has a .grad containing \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v}\\), which tells us how the final loss would change if we nudged that value. Here’s a concrete example. Note that a is used twice (the graph branches), so its gradient is the sum of both paths: a = Value ( 2.0 ) b = Value ( 3.0 ) c = a * b # c = 6.0 L = c + a # L = 8.0 L . backward () print ( a . grad ) # 4.0 (dL/da = b + 1 = 3 + 1, via both paths) print ( b . grad ) # 2.0 (dL/db = a = 2) This is exactly what PyTorch’s .backward() gives you: import torch a = torch . tensor ( 2.0 , requires_grad = True ) b = torch . tensor ( 3.0 , requires_grad = True ) c = a * b L = c + a L . backward () print ( a . grad ) # tensor(4.) print ( b . grad ) # tensor(2.) This is the same algorithm that PyTorch’s loss.backward() runs, just on scalars instead of tensors (arrays of scalars) - algorithmically identical, significantly smaller and simpler, but of course a lot less efficient. Let’s spell what the .backward() gives us above. Autograd calculated that if L = a*b + a , and a=2 and b=3 , then a.grad = 4.0 is telling us about the local influence of a on L . If you wiggle the inmput a , in what direction is L changing? Here, the derivative of L w.r.t. a is 4.0, meaning that if we increase a by a tiny amount (say 0.001), L would increase by about 4x that (0.004). Similarly, b.grad = 2.0 means the same nudge to b would increase L by about 2x that (0.002). In other words, these gradients tell us the direction (positive or negative depending on the sign), and the steepness (the magnitude) of the influence of each individual input on the final output (the loss). This then allows us to interately nudge the parameters of our neural network to lower the loss, and hence improve its predictions. Parameters The parameters are the knowledge of the model. They are a large collection of floating point numbers (wrapped in Value for autograd) that start out random and are iteratively optimized during training. The exact role of each parameter will make more sense once we define the model architecture below, but for now we just need to initialize them: n_embd = 16 # embedding dimension n_head = 4 # number of attention heads n_layer = 1 # number of layers block_size = 16 # maximum sequence length head_dim = n_embd // n_head # dimension of each head matrix = lambda nout , nin , std = 0.08 : [[ Value ( random . gauss ( 0 , std )) for _ in range ( nin )] for _ in range ( nout )] state_dict = { 'wte' : matrix ( vocab_size , n_embd ), 'wpe' : matrix ( block_size , n_embd ), 'lm_head' : matrix ( vocab_size , n_embd )} for i in range ( n_layer ): state_dict [ f 'layer { i } .attn_wq' ] = matrix ( n_embd , n_embd ) state_dict [ f 'layer { i } .attn_wk' ] = matrix ( n_embd , n_embd ) state_dict [ f 'layer { i } .attn_wv' ] = matrix ( n_embd , n_embd ) state_dict [ f 'layer { i } .attn_wo' ] = matrix ( n_embd , n_embd ) state_dict [ f 'layer { i } .mlp_fc1' ] = matrix ( 4 * n_embd , n_embd ) state_dict [ f 'layer { i } .mlp_fc2' ] = matrix ( n_embd , 4 * n_embd ) params = [ p for mat in state_dict . values () for row in mat for p in row ] print ( f \"num params: { len ( params ) } \" ) Each parameter is initialized to a small random number drawn from a Gaussian distribution. The state_dict organizes them into named matrices (borrowing PyTorch’s terminology): embedding tables, attention weights, MLP weights, and a final output projection. We also flatten all parameters into a single list params so the optimizer can loop over them later. In our tiny model this comes out to 4,192 parameters. GPT-2 had 1.6 billion, and modern LLMs have hundreds of billions. Architecture The model architecture is a stateless function: it takes a token, a position, the parameters, and the cached keys/values from previous positions, and returns logits (scores) over what token the model things should come next in the sequence. We follow GPT-2 with minor simplifications: RMSNorm instead of LayerNorm, no biases, and ReLU instead of GeLU. First, three small helper functions: def linear ( x , w ): return [ sum ( wi * xi for wi , xi in zip ( wo , x )) for wo in w ] linear is a matrix-vector multiply. It takes a vector x and a weight matrix w , and computes one dot product per row of w . This is the fundamental building block of neural networks: a learned linear transformation. def softmax ( logits ): max_val = max ( val . data for val in logits ) exps = [( val - max_val ). exp () for val in logits ] total = sum ( exps ) return [ e / total for e in exps ] softmax converts a vector of raw scores (logits), which can range from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\), into a probability distribution: all values end up in \\([0, 1]\\) and sum to 1. We subtract the max first for numerical stability (it doesn’t change the result mathematically, but prevents overflow in exp ). def rmsnorm ( x ): ms = sum ( xi * xi for xi in x ) / len ( x ) scale = ( ms + 1e-5 ) ** - 0.5 return [ xi * scale for xi in x ] rmsnorm (Root Mean Square Normalization) rescales a vector so its values have unit root-mean-square. This keeps activations from growing or shrinking as they flow through the network, which stabilizes training. It’s a simpler variant of the LayerNorm used in the original GPT-2. Now the model itself: def gpt ( token_id , pos_id , keys , values ): tok_emb = state_dict [ 'wte' ][ token_id ] # token embedding pos_emb = state_dict [ 'wpe' ][ pos_id ] # position embedding x = [ t + p for t , p in zip ( tok_emb , pos_emb )] # joint token and position embedding x = rmsnorm ( x ) for li in range ( n_layer ): # 1) Multi-head attention block x_residual = x x = rmsnorm ( x ) q = linear ( x , state_dict [ f 'layer { li } .attn_wq' ]) k = linear ( x , state_dict [ f 'layer { li } .attn_wk' ]) v = linear ( x , state_dict [ f 'layer { li } .attn_wv' ]) keys [ li ]. append ( k ) values [ li ]. append ( v ) x_attn = [] for h in range ( n_head ): hs = h * head_dim q_h = q [ hs : hs + head_dim ] k_h = [ ki [ hs : hs + head_dim ] for ki in keys [ li ]] v_h = [ vi [ hs : hs + head_dim ] for vi in values [ li ]] attn_logits = [ sum ( q_h [ j ] * k_h [ t ][ j ] for j in range ( head_dim )) / head_dim ** 0.5 for t in range ( len ( k_h ))] attn_weights = softmax ( attn_logits ) head_out = [ sum ( attn_weights [ t ] * v_h [ t ][ j ] for t in range ( len ( v_h ))) for j in range ( head_dim )] x",

      "content_text": "Friday afternoon, just as this interview was getting underway, a news alert flashed across my computer screen: the Trump administration was severing ties with Anthropic, the San Francisco AI company founded in 2021 by Dario Amodei. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had invoked a national security law to blacklist the company from doing business with the Pentagon after Amodei refused to allow Anthropic’s tech to be used for mass surveillance of U.S. citizens or for autonomous armed drones that could select and kill targets without human input. It was a jaw-dropping sequence. Anthropic stands to lose a contract worth up to $200 million and will be barred from working with other defense contractors after President Trump posted on Truth Social directing every federal agency to “immediately cease all use of Anthropic technology.” (Anthropic has since said it will challenge the Pentagon in court .) Max Tegmark has spent the better part of a decade warning that the race to build ever-more-powerful AI systems is outpacing the world’s ability to govern them. The MIT physicist founded the Future of Life Institute in 2014 and helped organize an open letter — ultimately signed by more than 33,000 people, including Elon Musk — calling for a pause in advanced AI development. His view of the Anthropic crisis is unsparing: the company, like its rivals, has sown the seeds of its own predicament. Tegmark’s argument doesn’t begin with the Pentagon but with a decision made years earlier — a choice, shared across the industry, to resist binding regulation. Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind and others have long promised to govern themselves responsibly. Anthropic this week even dropped the central tenet of its own safety pledge — its promise not to release increasingly powerful AI systems until the company was confident they wouldn’t cause harm. Now, in the absence of rules, there’s not a lot to protect these players, says Tegmark. Here’s more from that interview, edited for length and clarity. You can hear the full conversation this coming week on TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC Download podcast. When you saw this news just now about Anthropic, what was your first reaction? The road to hell is paved with good intentions. It’s so interesting to think back a decade ago, when people were so excited about how we were going to make artificial intelligence to cure cancer, to grow the prosperity in America and make America strong. And here we are now where the U.S. government is pissed off at this company for not wanting AI to be used for domestic mass surveillance of Americans, and also not wanting to have killer robots that can autonomously — without any human input at all — decide who gets killed. Techcrunch event San Francisco, CA | October 13-15, 2026 Anthropic has staked its entire identity on being a safety-first AI company, and yet it was collaborating with defense and intelligence agencies [dating back to at least 2024]. Do you think that’s at all contradictory? It is contradictory. If I can give a little cynical take on this — yes, Anthropic has been very good at marketing themselves as all about safety. But if you actually look at the facts rather than the claims, what you see is that Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind and xAI have all talked a lot about how they care about safety. None of them has come out supporting binding safety regulation the way we have in other industries. And all four of these companies have now broken their own promises. First we had Google — this big slogan, ‘Don’t be evil.’ Then they dropped that. Then they dropped another longer commitment that basically said they promised not to do harm with AI. They dropped that so they could sell AI for surveillance and weapons. OpenAI just dropped the word safety from their mission statement. xAI shut down their whole safety team. And now Anthropic, earlier in the week, dropped their most important safety commitment — the promise not to release powerful AI systems until they were sure they weren’t going to cause harm. How did companies that made such prominent safety commitments end up in this position? All of these companies, especially OpenAI and Google DeepMind but to some extent also Anthropic, have persistently lobbied against regulation of AI, saying, ‘Just trust us, we’re going to regulate ourselves.’ And they’ve successfully lobbied. So we right now have less regulation on AI systems in America than on sandwiches. You know, if you want to open a sandwich shop and the health inspector finds 15 rats in the kitchen, he won’t let you sell any sandwiches until you fix it. But if you say, ‘Don’t worry, I’m not going to sell sandwiches, I’m going to sell AI girlfriends for 11-year-olds, and they’ve been linked to suicides in the past, and then I’m going to release something called superintelligence which might overthrow the U.S. government, but I have a good feeling about mine’ — the inspector has to say, ‘Fine, go ahead, just don’t sell sandwiches.’ There’s food safety regulation and no AI regulation. And this, I feel, all of these companies really share the blame for. Because if they had taken all these promises that they made back in the day for how they were going to be so safe and goody-goody, and gotten together, and then gone to the government and said, ‘Please take our voluntary commitments and turn them into U.S. law that binds even our most sloppy competitors’ — this would have happened instead. We’re in a complete regulatory vacuum. And we know what happens when there’s a complete corporate amnesty: you get thalidomide , you get tobacco companies pushing cigarettes on kids, you get asbestos causing lung cancer. So it’s sort of ironic that their own resistance to having laws saying what’s okay and not okay to do with AI is now coming back and biting them. There is no law right now against building AI to kill Americans, so the government can just suddenly ask for it. If the companies themselves had earlier come out and said, ‘We want this law,’ they wouldn’t be in this pickle. They really shot themselves in the foot. The companies’ counter-argument is always the race with China — if American companies don’t do this, Beijing will. Does that argument hold? Let’s analyze that. The most common talking point from the lobbyists for the AI companies — they’re now better funded and more numerous than the lobbyists from the fossil fuel industry, the pharma industry and the military-industrial complex combined — is that whenever anyone proposes any kind of regulation, they say, ‘But China.’ So let’s look at that. China is in the process of banning AI girlfriends outright. Not just age limits — they’re looking at banning all anthropomorphic AI . Why? Not because they want to please America but because they feel this is screwing up Chinese youth and making China weak. Obviously, it’s making American youth weak, too. And when people say we have to race to build superintelligence so we can win against China — when we don’t actually know how to control superintelligence, so that the default outcome is that humanity loses control of Earth to alien machines — guess what? The Chinese Communist Party really likes control. Who in their right mind thinks that Xi Jinping is going to tolerate some Chinese AI company building something that overthrows the Chinese government? No way. It’s clearly really bad for the American government too if it gets overthrown in a coup by the first American company to build superintelligence. This is a national security threat. That’s compelling framing — superintelligence as a national security threat, not an asset. Do you see that view gaining traction in Washington? I think if people in the national security community listen to Dario Amodei describe his vision — he’s given a famous speech where he says we’ll soon have a country of geniuses in a data center — they might start thinking: wait, did Dario just use the word ‘country’? Maybe I should put that country of geniuses in a data center on the same threat list I’m keeping tabs on, because that sounds threatening to the U.S. government. And I think fairly soon, enough people in the U.S. national security community are going to realize that uncontrollable superintelligence is a threat, not a tool. This is totally analogous to the Cold War. There was a race for dominance — economic and military — against the Soviet Union. We Americans won that one without ever engaging in the second race, which was to see who could put the most nuclear craters in the other superpower. People realized that was just suicide. No one wins. The same logic applies here. What does all of this mean for the pace of AI development more broadly? How close do you think we are to the systems you’re describing? Six years ago, almost every expert in AI I knew predicted we were decades away from having AI that could master language and knowledge at human level — maybe 2040, maybe 2050. They were all wrong, because we already have that now. We’ve seen AI progress quite rapidly from high school level to college level to PhD level to university professor level in some areas. Last year, AI won the gold medal at the International Mathematics Olympiad, which is about as difficult as human tasks get. I wrote a paper together with Yoshua Bengio , Dan Hendrycks , and other top AI researchers just a few months ago giving a rigorous definition of AGI. According to this, GPT-4 was 27% of the way there. GPT-5 was 57% of the way there. So we’re not there yet, but going from 27% to 57% that quickly suggests it might not be that long. When I lectured to my students yesterday at MIT, I told them that even if it takes four years, that means when they graduate, they might not be able to get any jobs anymore. It’s certainly not too soon to start preparing for it. Anthropic is now blacklisted. I’m curious to see what happens next — will the other AI giants stand with them and say, we won’t do this either? Or does someone like xAI raise their hand and say, Anthropic didn’t want that contract, we’ll take it? [Editor’s note: Hours after the interview, OpenAI announced its own deal with the Pentagon.] Last night, Sam Altman came out and said he stands with Anthropic and has the same red lines. I admire him for the courage of saying that. Google, as of when we started this interview, had said nothing. If they just stay quiet, I think that’s incredibly embarrassing for them as a company, and a lot of their staff will feel the same. We haven’t heard anything from xAI yet either. So it’ll be interesting to see. Basically, there’s this moment where everybody has to show their true colors. Is there a version of this where the outcome is actually good? Yes, and this is why I’m actually optimistic in a strange way. There’s such an obvious alternative here. If we just start treating AI companies like any other companies — drop the corporate amnesty — they would clearly have to do something like a clinical trial before they released something this powerful, and demonstrate to independent experts that they know how to control it. Then we get a golden age with all the good stuff from AI, without the existential angst. That’s not the path we’re on right now. But it could be.",

      "content_text": "Minutes after Donald Trump announced that the US and Israeli governments had launched a “major combat operation” against Iran in the early hours of Saturday morning, disinformation about the attack and Tehran’s response flooded X . WIRED has reviewed hundreds of posts on X , some of which have racked up millions of views, that promote misleading claims about the locations and scale of the attack. Elon Musk’s social media platform is a verifiable mess: In some cases, alleged video footage of the attack shared in posts on X are actually months or years old. In several posts, video footage of apparent attacks have been attributed to incorrect locations. A number of images shared on X appear to be altered or generated with AI . Other posts attempt to pass off video game footage as scenes from the conflict. X did not respond to a request for comment. Under Musk’s stewardship , X has become a haven for disinformation , especially during major global breaking news events. At the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, and more recently during anti-immigration enforcement protests in LA , the platform has drowned in inaccurate and faulty posts. Almost all of the most viral posts reviewed by WIRED on Saturday came from accounts with blue check marks, meaning they pay X for its premium service and could be eligible to earn money based on how much engagement their posts generate, even if the content is false. While some posts with disinformation have a community note appended beneath them to correct the record, they remain up on the site, and it’s unclear how many people viewed them before the notes appeared. One video posted by a blue check mark account claimed to show ballistic missiles over Dubai; the clip actually showed Iranian ballistic missiles fired at Tel Aviv in October 2024. The post has been viewed over 4.4 million times. One of the most viral clips shared on X in the hours after the attack claims to show an Israeli fighter jet being shot down by Iranian air defense systems. The video has been shared by dozens of accounts, including one post which has been viewed more than 3.5 million times. The provenance of the video is unclear, but there have been no credible reports of any Israeli jets being shot down over Iran on Saturday. Another account that claims to be an expert in open source intelligence posted a video showing explosions, alongside the caption: “6 Iranian Hypersonic Missiles hit the Indian-invested Israeli Haifa port. Massive damages reported.” The video has been viewed 64,000 times, but the footage was actually captured last July and shows an Israeli attack on the defense ministry in Damascus, Syria. In a number of cases, pro-Iranian accounts have been using images and footage from Saturday’s attacks to falsely claim successful strikes against Israel. “IRANIAN MISSILE IMPACT IN TEL AVIV RIGHT NOW,” the Iran Observer account wrote in a post featuring an image of Dubai. The post had been viewed over 200,000 times before it was deleted, but dozens of other posts sharing the same image and making the same claims remain on X. Tehran Times, a news outlet aligned with the Iranian government, posted what appears to be an AI-generated image on X which claims to show that “an American radar in Qatar was completely destroyed today in an Iranian drone strike.” The use of AI generated images was flagged on X by Tal Hagin, a senior analyst with open source intelligence company Golden Owl. While there are reports that drone and missile attacks targeted the US Navy’s 5th Fleet headquarters in Bahrain, there are no reports yet of similar successful attacks in Qatar. A pro-Trump account, which also features a blue check mark, posted images claiming to show the before and after pictures of the palace of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, which was targeted during Saturday’s missile attacks. (In a post on Truth Social, Trump claimed Khamenei was killed in an attack.) While the after picture appears to accurately show the palace after the attack, the before picture shows the Mausoleum of Ruhollah Khomeini, which is located on the other side of Tehran. The post has been viewed 365,000 times.",

For one thing, the streaming giant’s shareholders appeared deeply skeptical that the acquisition was a good deal — Netflix’s share price declined 30% since announcing the deal, while the subsequent news that it was backing down sent Netflix stock up nearly 14% . For another, Netflix’s commitment to the deal reportedly wavered after Paramount came in with an increased offer and seemed willing to go several more rounds in a bidding war.

      "content_text": "The streaming and entertainment industry just witnessed one of its most high-stakes megadeals ever, stunning industry observers. Not only is it historic in its size, but it is also predicted to disrupt Hollywood and the media business as we know it. After years of Warner Bros. Discovery struggling under the weight of billions of dollars in debt, compounded by declining cable viewership and fierce competition from streaming platforms, the company has been considering major strategic changes, including selling its entertainment assets to one of its rivals. Several major players saw the potential in acquiring the media giant and in December, Netflix announced it would acquire WBD’s studios and streaming for $82.7 billion. But in a surprise eleventh-hour move this month, it now looks like the David Ellison-run Paramount will actually be the winner of this bidding war, offering $111 billion to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery’s assets, including its studios, HBO, streaming platforms, games, and TV networks such as CNN and HGTV. Paramount was itself recently acquired by Ellison with significant support from his father, the Oracle chairman, world’s sixth-richest person, and major Trump donor Larry Ellison. Paramount’s offer still awaits formal approval from WBD’s board of directors, and any potential agreement may also face pressure from regulators. Let’s break down exactly what is happening, what’s at stake, and what could come next. What has happened so far? ​This all started back in October when Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) revealed it was exploring a potential sale after receiving unsolicited interest from several major players in the industry. Techcrunch event San Francisco, CA | October 13-15, 2026 ​The bidding process quickly became competitive, and Paramount and Comcast emerged as serious contenders, with Paramount initially viewed as the frontrunner. However, WBD’s board eventually determined that an offer from the streaming giant Netflix was the most attractive. Netflix offered $82.7 billion for just Warner’s film, television, and streaming assets. Thus began the bidding war. Paramount believed its bid, of approximately $108 billion for all of Warner’s assets, was superior to Netflix’s offer that focused on just the studios and streaming. To sweeten its deal, Netflix amended its agreement in January to an all-cash offer at $27.75 per share of Warner Bros. Discovery, further reassuring investors and paving the way for the deal to proceed. ​Paramount persisted in its attempts to acquire WBD . Still, the Warner board repeatedly rejected its offers, citing concerns about Paramount’s heavy debt load and the increased risk associated with its proposal, including concern over the suite of investors bankrolling Paramount’s bid, which includes Saudi, Qatari, and Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds. The board noted that Paramount’s offer would have left the combined company burdened with $87 billion in debt, a risk they were unwilling to take at the time. In January, Paramount filed a lawsuit seeking more information about the Netflix deal. A month later, the company sought to sweeten its deal by announcing it would offer a $0.25 per share “ticking fee” to WBD shareholders for each quarter the deal fails to close by December 31, 2026. It also said it would pay the $2.8 billion breakup fee if Warner backs out of its deal with Netflix. Then, in a final attempt to secure a deal, Paramount increased its offer to $31 per share in February. This prompted the WBD board to prolong discussions with Paramount regarding a potential agreement, considering it as a superior offer. Netflix declined to increase its bid and withdrew from the negotiations. “The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement on Feb. 26. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.” In addition to the billions Paramount already holds in debt, the company is also set to assume the approximately $33 billion in debt Warner Bros. Discovery holds under the agreement . The deal will be backed by a $54 billion debt commitment from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, and Apollo Global Management, as well as $45.7 billion in equity from Larry Ellison. Regulatory hurdles and other concerns Image Credits: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch In addition to the assumption of substantial debt posing a significant financial burden, Paramount faces several other hurdles in its deal with WBD that could impact the success of the transaction. For one, Ellison has warned about significant job reductions that are expected in the near future. There have already been widespread concerns among critics about potential job losses and lower wages. Ellison is also a controversial figure in the industry, and his ownership of CBS News has been seen as sympathetic and supportive of the administration of Donald Trump, of whom his father, Larry Ellison, is a major donor. Under Ellison’s ownership of Paramount, reporting critical of the administration has been shelved or received increased scrutiny from Ellison or his appointed head of CBS News, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. This has led to some concern among employees at Warner-owned CNN. Trump has personally sought concessions from news divisions critical of him, including a $16 million settlement from CBS , before his FCC would approve the Ellison takeover of Paramount. Before Netflix bowed out of the deal, Trump pressured the company to fire the former Biden White House official Susan Rice from its board. He has publicly stated his intentions to bring CNN to heel under new owners. Regulatory scrutiny is another hurdle. Such a large-scale merger has attracted attention from lawmakers. For instance, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement on February 26 that “these two Hollywood titans have not cleared regulatory scrutiny — the California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review.” A day before Netflix backed out, it was revealed that a coalition of 11 state attorneys general urged the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to review the merger under concerns it will stifle competition and increase subscription prices. This comes months after U.S. senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal voiced their concerns to the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division , warning that such a massive merger could have serious consequences for consumers and the industry at large. The senators argue that the merger could give the new media giant excessive market power, enabling it to raise prices for consumers and stifle competition. That said, Ellison’s father, the Oracle chairman Larry Ellison, is a significant Trump donor and has close ties to the Trump administration. His deal to acquire Paramount last year cleared quickly after acquiescing to c When is the deal expected to close? The deal is not yet final. Initially, a deal with Netflix was expected to lead to a stockholder vote around April, with the deal anticipated to close within 12 to 18 months following that vote. However, the transition to the Paramount deal will likely create a new timeline for approval. Plus, regulatory approvals are still pending, and scrutiny could shape the final outcome. Stay tuned…",

      "summary": "Here's everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI.",
      "content_text": "It takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product — and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, there’s a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a recent earnings call , Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit. Below, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher. Microsoft’s 2019 investment in OpenAI This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: In 2019 , Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come in the form of Azure cloud credit rather than cash. It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company. The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. Last year, OpenAI announced it would no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively , instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. Microsoft has also begun exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant. OpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while making kernel-level modifications on the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September , giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs. The rise of Oracle On June 30, 2025, Oracle revealed in an SEC filing that it had signed a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner; this is more than the company’s cloud revenues for all of the previous fiscal year. OpenAI was eventually revealed as the partner, securing Oracle a spot alongside Google as one of OpenAI’s string of post-Microsoft hosting partners. Unsurprisingly, the company’s stock went shooting up. Techcrunch event San Francisco, CA | October 13-15, 2026 A few months later, it happened again. On September 10 , Oracle revealed a five-year, $300 billion deal for compute power, set to begin in 2027. Oracle’s stock climbed even higher , briefly making founder Larry Ellison the richest man in the world. The sheer scale of the deal is stunning: OpenAI does not have $300 billion to spend, so the figure presumes immense growth for both companies, and more than a little faith. But before a single dollar is spent, the deal has already cemented Oracle as one of the leading AI infrastructure providers — and a financial force to be reckoned with. Nvidia’s investment spree As AI labs scramble to build infrastructure, they’re mostly buying GPUs from one company: Nvidia. That trade has made Nvidia flush with cash — and it’s been investing that cash back into the industry in increasingly unconventional ways. In September 2025, Nvidia bought a 4% stake in rival Intel for $5 billion — but even more surprising has been the deals with its own customers. One week after the Intel deal was revealed, the company announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI , paid for with GPUs that would be used in OpenAI’s ongoing data center projects. Nvidia has since announced a similar deal with Elon Musk’s xAI, and OpenAI launched a separate GPU-for-stock arrangement with AMD. If that seems circular, it’s because it is. Nvidia’s GPUs are valuable because they’re so scarce — and by trading them directly into an ever-inflating data center scheme, Nvidia is making sure they stay that way. You could say the same thing about OpenAI’s privately held stock, which is all the more valuable because it can’t be obtained through public markets. For now, OpenAI and Nvidia are riding high and nobody seems too worried — but if the momentum starts to flag, this sort of arrangement will get a lot more scrutiny. Building tomorrow’s hyperscale data centers For companies like Meta that already have significant legacy infrastructure , the story is more complicated — although equally expensive. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that the company plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure through the end of 2028 . In the first half of 2025, the company spent $30 billion more than the previous year, driven largely by the company’s growing AI ambitions. Some of that spending goes toward big ticket cloud contracts, like a recent $10 billion deal with Google Cloud , but even more resources are being poured into two massive new data centers. A new 2,250-acre site in Louisiana, dubbed Hyperion , will cost an estimated $10 billion to build out and provide an estimated 5 gigawatts of compute power . Notably, the site includes an arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to handle the increased energy load. A smaller site in Ohio, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas. That kind of buildout comes with real environmental costs. Elon Musk’s xAI built its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. The plant has quickly become one of the county’s largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, thanks to a string of natural gas turbines that experts say violate the Clean Air Act . The Stargate moonshot Just two days after his second inauguration last January, President Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, meant to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the United States. Named “Stargate” after the 1994 film, the project arrived with incredible amounts of hype, with Trump calling it “the largest AI infrastructure project in history.” OpenAI’s Sam Altman seemed to agree, saying, ​​”I think this will be the most important project of this era.” In broad strokes, the plan was for SoftBank to provide the funding, with Oracle handling the buildout with input from OpenAI. Overseeing it all was Trump, who promised to clear away any regulatory hurdles that might slow down the build. But there were doubts from the beginning, including from Elon Musk, Altman’s business rival, who claimed the project did not have the available funds. As the hype has died down, the project has lost some momentum. In August , Bloomberg reported that the partners were failing to reach consensus. Nonetheless, the project has moved forward with the construction of eight data centers in Abilene, Texas , with construction on the final building set to be finished by the end of 2026. The capex crunch “Capital expenditures” are usually a pretty dry metric, referring to a company’s spending on physical assets. But as tech companies lined up to report their capex plans for 2026, the rush of data center spending made the figures a lot more interesting — and a lot bigger. Amazon was the capex leader, projecting $200 billion in 2026 spending (up from $131 billion in 2025), while Google was a close second with an estimate between $175 billion and $185 billion (up from $91 billion in 2025). Meta estimated $115 billion to $135 billion (up from $71 billion the previous year), although that figure is a little deceptive because a lot of the data center projects have been kept off their books entirely . All told, hyperscalers are planning to spend nearly $700 billion on data center projects in 2026 alone . It was enough money to spook some investors. The companies were mostly undeterred, however, explaining that AI infrastructure was vital to their companies’ future. It’s set up a strange dynamic. As you might expect, tech executives are more bullish on AI than their Wall Street counterparts — and the more tech companies spend, the more nervous their bankers get. Add in the huge amounts of debt many companies are taking on to fund those buildouts, and you start to hear CFOs across the valley grinding their teeth. That hasn’t put a damper on AI spending yet, but it will soon — unless of course, hyperscalers show they can make those investments pay off. This article was first published on September 22.",

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, earlier this week. He gave the company until Friday to commit to changing the terms of its contract to allow “all lawful use” of its models. Hegseth praised Anthropic’s products during the meeting and said that the Department of Defense wanted to continue working with Anthropic, according to one source familiar with interaction who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. Some experts say that the dispute boils down to a clash over vibes rather than concrete disagreements over how artificial intelligence should be deployed. “This is such an unnecessary dispute in my opinion,” says Michael Horowitz, an expert on military use of AI and former Deputy Assistant Secretary for emerging technologies at the Pentagon. “It is about theoretical use cases that are not on the table for now.” Horowitz notes that Anthropic has supported all of the ways the Department of Defense has proposed using its technology thus far. “My sense is that the Pentagon and Anthropic agree at present about the use cases where the technology is not ready for prime time,” he adds. Anthropic was founded on the idea that AI should be built with safety at its core. In January, Amoedi penned a blog post about the risks of powerful artificial intelligence that touched upon the dangers of fully autonomous AI-controlled weapons. “These weapons also have legitimate uses in the defense of democracy,” Amodei wrote. “But they are a dangerous weapon to wield.” Additional reporting by Paresh Dave.

But researchers and stargazers have been eagerly anticipating the launch of this system.

Differences are automatically flagged, and an algorithm can distinguish between potential supernovas and approaching asteroids to send alerts to interested parties, all in just a matter of minutes. This means scientists can quickly turn their attention to fleeting celestial events. Thankfully, the alerts aren’t all-or-nothing.

The author of the MMWR report, county health official Katherine Houser, noted that the beer-tent workers were hesitant to give details because they didn’t want to get any of their community members in trouble. But one let slip that someone had put leftover food in the cooler overnight at the start of the fair. The county health officials hypothesized that the cooler had become contaminated with Salmonella that spread to beer cans from which people then drank, allowing for infection. But with the makeshift cooler gone, it would remain only a hypothesis. So, the health investigators then turned to ChatGPT for assurances. After providing the chatbot with details of the outbreak, health investigators asked it several questions, including: “Will S. Agbeni grow in an improperly drained cooler?”; “Are any other sources, other than ice, likely if only canned beverages and no foods were available at this location?’ ; and “What examples of similar outbreaks have been documented in scientific literature?” Some of the questions are easy enough to answer without a chatbot. A simple search on PubMed, a federal database of scientific literature, quickly pulls up examples of Salmonella being found in ice, for example. But, the chatbot assured the officials that the cooler was a “credible and likely” source of the outbreak and they stuck with the hypothesis. In the end, the officials required new cooler sanitation protocols—and concluded that the AI assistance was helpful. “AI was effective in this rural setting for rapid situational awareness,” Houser wrote. However, she also acknowledged the potential concerns of using AI for outbreak investigations: “Given the inherent limitations of generative AI tools, including potential inaccuracies and lack of source transparency, all AI-generated summaries were critically reviewed and validated against primary literature before incorporation,” she wrote. Overall, the case report has a murky ending. It’s unclear how helpful the chatbot actually was in this case. Critically reviewing AI-generated answers can easily take as much time as simply researching the answer on one’s own. And of course, we’ll never know for certain what was really going on in that makeshift beer cooler—though the new cooler sanitation protocols seem like a good idea, regardless.",

      "content_text": "Verified Spec-Driven Development (VSDD) The Fusion: VDD × TDD × SDD for AI-Native Engineering Verified Spec-Driven Development (VSDD) is a unified software engineering methodology that fuses three proven paradigms into a single AI-orchestrated pipeline: Spec-Driven Development (SDD): Define the contract before writing a single line of implementation. Specs are the source of truth. Test-Driven Development (TDD): Tests are written before code. Red → Green → Refactor. No code exists without a failing test that demanded it. Verification-Driven Development (VDD): Subject all surviving code to adversarial refinement until a hyper-critical reviewer is forced to hallucinate flaws. VSDD treats these not as competing philosophies but as sequential gates in a single pipeline. Specs define what . Tests enforce how . Adversarial verification ensures nothing was missed . AI models orchestrate every phase, with the human developer serving as the strategic decision-maker and final authority. Role Entity Function The Architect Human Developer Strategic vision, domain expertise, acceptance authority. Signs off on specs, arbitrates disputes between Builder and Adversary. The Builder Claude (or similar) Spec authorship, test generation, code implementation, and refactoring. Operates under strict TDD constraints. The Tracker Chainlink Hierarchical issue decomposition — Epics → Issues → Sub-issues (\"beads\"). Every spec, test, and implementation maps to a bead. The Adversary Sarcasmotron (Gemini Gem or equivalent) Hyper-critical reviewer with zero patience. Reviews specs, tests, and implementation. Fresh context on every pass. Phase 1 — Spec Crystallization Nothing gets built until the contract is airtight — and the architecture is verification-ready by design. The human developer describes the feature intent to the Builder. The Builder then produces a formal specification document for each unit of work. Critically, this phase doesn't just define what the software does — it defines what must be provable about it and structures the architecture accordingly. Step 1a: Behavioral Specification The Builder produces the functional contract: Behavioral Contract: What the module/function/endpoint must do, expressed as preconditions, postconditions, and invariants. Interface Definition: Input types, output types, error types. No ambiguity. If it's an API, this is the OpenAPI/GraphQL schema. If it's a module, this is the type signature and doc contract. Edge Case Catalog: Explicitly enumerated boundary conditions, degenerate inputs, and failure modes. The Builder is prompted to be exhaustive here — \"What happens when the input is null? Empty? Maximum size? Negative? Unicode? Concurrent?\" Non-Functional Requirements: Performance bounds, memory constraints, security considerations baked into the spec itself. Step 1b: Verification Architecture Before any implementation design is finalized, the Builder produces a Verification Strategy that answers: \"What properties of this system must be mathematically provable, and what architectural constraints does that impose?\" This includes: Provable Properties Catalog: Which invariants, safety properties, and correctness guarantees must be formally verified — not just tested? Examples: \"This state machine can never reach an invalid state.\" \"This arithmetic can never overflow.\" \"This parser always terminates.\" \"This access control check is never bypassed.\" The Builder distinguishes between properties that should be proven (critical path, security boundaries, financial calculations) and properties where test coverage is sufficient (UI formatting, logging, non-critical defaults). Purity Boundary Map: A clear architectural separation between the deterministic, side-effect-free core (where formal verification can operate) and the effectful shell (I/O, network, database, user interaction). This is the most consequential design decision in VSDD — it dictates module boundaries, dependency direction, and how state flows through the system. The pure core must be designed so that verification tools can reason about it without mocking the entire universe. Verification Tooling Selection: Based on the language and the properties to be proven, the Builder selects the appropriate formal verification stack (Kani for Rust, CBMC for C/C++, Dafny, TLA+ for distributed systems, etc.) and identifies any constraints these tools impose on code structure. This happens now , not after the code is written, because tool constraints are architectural constraints. Property Specifications: Where possible, the Builder drafts the actual formal property definitions (e.g., Kani proof harnesses, Dafny contracts, TLA+ invariants) alongside the behavioral spec. These aren't implementation — they're the formal expression of what the spec already says in natural language. They serve as a second, mathematically precise encoding of the requirements. Why this must happen in Phase 1: If the system is designed with side effects woven through the core logic, no amount of Phase 5 heroics will make it verifiable. A function that reads from a database, performs a calculation, and writes to a log in one block cannot be formally verified without mocking infrastructure that the verifier may not support. But a function that takes data in, returns a result, and lets the caller handle persistence — that's a function a model checker can reason about. This boundary must be drawn at the spec level because it fundamentally shapes the module decomposition, the dependency graph, and the testing strategy that follows. Step 1c: Spec Review Gate The complete spec — behavioral contracts and verification architecture — is reviewed by both the human and the Adversary before any tests are written. Sarcasmotron tears into the spec looking for: Ambiguous language that could be interpreted multiple ways Missing edge cases Implicit assumptions that aren't stated Contradictions between different parts of the spec Properties claimed as \"testable only\" that should be provable (the Adversary pushes back on lazy verification boundaries) Purity boundary violations — logic marked as \"pure core\" that actually depends on external state Verification tool mismatches — properties the selected tooling can't actually prove The spec is iterated until the Adversary can't find legitimate holes in either the behavioral contract or the verification strategy. Chainlink Integration: Each spec maps to a Chainlink Issue. Sub-issues are generated for each behavioral contract item, edge case, non-functional requirement, and each formally provable property. The provable properties get their own bead chain so their status is tracked independently from test coverage. Phase 2 — Test-First Implementation (The TDD Core) Red → Green → Refactor, enforced by AI. With an airtight spec in hand, the Builder now writes tests — and only tests. No implementation code yet. Step 2a: Test Suite Generation The Builder translates the spec directly into executable tests: Unit Tests: One or more tests per behavioral contract item. Every postcondition becomes an assertion. Every precondition violation becomes a test that expects a specific error. Edge Case Tests: Every item in the Edge Case Catalog becomes a test. These are the tests that catch the bugs that \"never happen in production\" (until they do). Integration Tests: Tests that verify the module works correctly within the larger system context defined in the spec. Property-Based Tests: Where applicable, the Builder generates property-based tests (e.g., using Hypothesis, fast-check, or proptest) that assert invariants hold across randomized inputs. The Red Gate: All tests must fail before any implementation begins. If a test passes without implementation, the test is suspect — it's either testing the wrong thing or the spec was wrong. The Builder flags this for human review. Step 2b: Minimal Implementation The Builder writes the minimum code necessary to make each test pass, one at a time. This is classic TDD discipline: Pick the next failing test. Write the smallest implementation that makes it pass. Run the full suite — nothing else should break. Repeat. Step 2c: Refactor After all tests are green, the Builder refactors for clarity, performance, and adherence to the non-functional requirements in the spec. The test suite acts as the safety net — if refactoring breaks something, the tests catch it immediately. Human Checkpoint: The developer reviews the test suite and implementation for alignment with the \"spirit\" of the spec. AI can miss intent even when it nails the letter of the contract. Phase 3 — Adversarial Refinement (The VDD Roast) The code survived testing. Now it faces the gauntlet. The verified, test-passing codebase — along with the spec and test suite — is presented to Sarcasmotron in a fresh context window. What the Adversary reviews: Spec Fidelity: Does the implementation actually satisfy the spec, or did the tests inadvertently encode a misunderstanding? Test Quality: Are the tests actually testing what they claim? Are there tests that would pass even if the implementation were subtly wrong? (Tautological tests, tests that mock too aggressively, tests that assert on implementation details rather than behavior.) Code Quality: The classic VDD roast — placeholder comments, generic error handling, inefficient patterns, hidden coupling, missing resource cleanup, race conditions. Security Surface: Input validation gaps, injection vectors, authentication/authorization assumptions. Spec Gaps Revealed by Implementation: Sometimes writing the code reveals that the spec was incomplete. The Adversary looks for implemented behavior that isn't covered by the spec. Negative Prompting: Sarcasmotron is prompted for zero tolerance. No \"overall this looks good, but...\" preamble. Every piece of feedback is a concrete flaw with a specific location and a proposed fix or question. Context Reset: Fresh context window on every adversarial pass. No relationship drift. No accumulated goodwill. Phase 4 — Feedback Integration Loop The Adversary's critique feeds back through the entire pipeline: Spec-level flaws → Return to Phase 1. Update the spec, re-review. Test-level flaws → Return to Phase 2a. Fix or add tests, verify they fail against the current implementation (or a deliberately broken version), then fix implementation if needed. Implementation-level flaws → Return to Phase 2c. Refactor, ensure all tests still pass. New edge cases discovered → Add to spec's Edge Case Catalog, write new failing tests, implement fixes. This loop continues until convergence (see Phase 6). Phase 5 — Formal Hardening (Executing the Verification Plan) The verification architecture designed in Phase 1b is now executed against the battle-tested implementation. Because the codebase was architected from the start with a pure core and clear purity boundaries, formal verification tools can operate on it without heroic refactoring. Proof Execution: The property specifications drafted in Phase 1b (Kani harnesses, Dafny contracts, TLA+ invariants, etc.) are run against the implementation. Because the architecture was designed for verifiability, these proofs should engage cleanly with the pure core. Failures here indicate either implementation bugs or spec properties that need refinement — both feed back through Phase 4. Fuzz Testing: Structured fuzzing (AFL++, libFuzzer, cargo-fuzz) is layered on top of property-based tests to find inputs that no human or AI anticipated. The deterministic core is an ideal fuzz target because it has no environmental dependencies to mock. Security Hardening: Suites like Wycheproof (cryptographic edge cases) and Semgrep (static analysis) are run as CI/CD gates. Mutation Testing: Tools like mutmut or Stryker mutate the code to verify the test suite actually catches real bugs. If a mutation survives, the test suite has a gap. Purity Boundary Audit: A final check that the purity boundaries defined in Phase 1b have been respected throughout implementation. Any side effects that crept into the pure core during development are flagged and refactored out. All formal verification and fuzzing results feed back into Phase 4 if issues are found. Phase 6 — Convergence (The Exit Signal) VSDD inherits VDD's hallucination-based termination , extended across all three dimensions: Dimension Convergence Signal Spec The Adversary's spec critiques are nitpicks about wording, not about missing behavior, ambiguity, or verification gaps. Tests The Adversary can't identify a meaningful untested scenario. Mutation testing confirms high kill rate. Implementation The Adversary is forced to invent problems that don't exist in the code. Verification All properties from the Phase 1b catalog pass formal proof. Fuzzers find nothing. Purity boundaries are intact. Maximum Viable Refinement is reached when all four dimensions have converged. The software is considered Zero-Slop — every line of code traces to a spec requirement, is covered by a test, has survived adversarial scrutiny, and the critical path is formally proven. III. The VSDD Contract Chain One of VSDD's defining properties is full traceability . Every artifact links back: Spec Requirement → Verification Property → Chainlink Bead → Test Case → Implementation → Adversarial Review → Formal Proof At any point, you can ask: \"Why does this line of code exist?\" and trace it all the way back to a specific spec requirement, through the verification property it satisfies, the test that demanded it, the adversarial review that hardened it, and the formal proof that guarantees it. Equally, you can ask \"Why is this module structured as a pure function?\" and trace that decision back to the Purity Boundary Map in Phase 1b. IV. Core Principles of VSDD Spec Supremacy: The spec is the highest authority below the human developer. Tests serve the spec. Code serves the tests. Nothing exists without a reason traced to the spec. Verification-First Architecture: The need for formal provability shapes the design, not the other way around. Pure core, effectful shell. If you can't verify it, you architected it wrong — and you find that out in Phase 1, not Phase 5. Red Before Green: No implementation code is written until a failing test demands it. AI models are explicitly constrained to follow TDD discipline — no \"let me just write the whole thing and add tests after.\" Anti-Slop Bias: The first \"correct\" version is assumed to contain hidden debt. Trust is earned through adversarial survival, not initial appearance. Forced Negativity: Adversarial pressure bypasses the politeness filters of standard LLM interactions. The Adversary doesn't care about your feelings — it cares about your invariants. Linear Accountability: Chainlink beads ensure every spec item, test, and line of code has a corresponding tracked unit of work. Nothing slips through the cracks. Entropy Resistance: Context resets on every adversarial pass prevent the natural degradation of long-running AI conversations. Four-Dimensional Convergence: The system isn't done until specs, tests, implementation, and formal proofs have all independently survived adversarial review. V. AI Orchestration Notes VSDD is explicitly designed for multi-model AI workflows: The Builder benefits from large context windows and strong code generation (Claude, GPT-4, etc.). It needs to hold the full spec, test suite, and implementation simultaneously. The Adversary benefits from a different model or configuration to avoid shared blind spots. Using a different model family (e.g., Gemini as Adversary when Claude is Builder) introduces genuine cognitive diversity. The Human is not a bottleneck — they're the strategic layer. They approve specs, resolve disputes, and make judgment calls that AI can't. The human's role is elevated , not diminished, by the AI orchestration. Prompt Engineering for TDD Discipline: The Builder must be explicitly instructed: \"You are operating under strict TDD. Write tests FIRST. Do NOT write imp",

      "summary": "OpenAI's CEO claims its new defense contract includes protections addressing the same issues that became a flashpoint for Anthropic.",
      "content_text": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced late on Friday that his company has reached an agreement allowing the Department of Defense to use its AI models in the department’s classified network. This follows a high-profile standoff between the DoD — also known under the Trump administration as the Department of War — and OpenAI’s rival Anthropic. The Pentagon pushed AI companies, including Anthropic, to allow their models to be used for “all lawful purposes,” while Anthropic sought to draw a red line around mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons. In a lengthy statement released Thursday , Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said the company “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner,” but he argued that “in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.” More than 60 OpenAI employees and 300 Google employees signed an open letter this week asking their employers to support Anthropic’s position. After Anthropic and the Pentagon failed to reach an agreement, President Donald Trump criticized the “Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic” in a social media post that also directed federal agencies to stop using the company’s products after a six-month phase-out period. In a separate post , Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth claimed Anthropic was trying to “seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military.” Hegseth also said he is designating Anthropic as a supply-chain risk: “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.” On Friday, Anthropic said it had “not yet received direct communication from the Department of War or the White House on the status of our negotiations,” but insisted it would “challenge any supply chain risk designation in court.” Techcrunch event San Francisco, CA | October 13-15, 2026 Surprisingly, Altman claimed in a post on X that OpenAI’s new defense contract includes protections addressing the same issues that became a flashpoint for Anthropic. “Two of our most important safety principles are prohibitions on domestic mass surveillance and human responsibility for the use of force, including for autonomous weapon systems,” Altman said. “The DoW agrees with these principles, reflects them in law and policy, and we put them into our agreement.” Altman said OpenAI “will build technical safeguards to ensure our models behave as they should, which the DoW also wanted,” and it will deploy engineers with the Pentagon “to help with our models and to ensure their safety.” “We are asking the DoW to offer these same terms to all AI companies, which in our opinion we think everyone should be willing to accept,” Altman added. “We have expressed our strong desire to see things de-escalate away from legal and governmental actions and towards reasonable agreements.” Fortune’s Sharon Goldman reports that Altman told OpenAI employees at an all-hands meeting that the government will allow the company to build its own “safety stack” to prevent misuse and that “if the model refuses to do a task, then the government would not force OpenAI to make it do that task.” Altman’s post came shortly before news broke that the U.S. and Israeli governments have begun bombing Iran , with Trump calling for the overthrow of the Iranian government.",
