      "content_text": "By CEO Sam Altman’s own admission, OpenAI’s deal with the Department of Defense was “definitely rushed,” and “the optics don’t look good.” After negotiations between Anthropic and the Pentagon fell through on Friday, President Donald Trump directed federal agencies to stop using Anthropic’s technology after a six-month transition period , and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said he was designating the AI company as a supply-chain risk. Then, OpenAI quickly announced that it had reached a deal of its own for models to be deployed in classified environments. With Anthropic saying it was drawing red lines around the use of its technology in fully autonomous weapons or mass domestic surveillance, and Altman saying OpenAI had the same red lines, there were some obvious questions: Was OpenAI being honest about its safeguards? Why was it able to reach a deal while Anthropic was not? So as OpenAI executives defended the agreement on social media, the company also published a blog post outlining its approach . In fact, the post pointed to three areas where it said OpenAI’s models cannot be used — mass domestic surveillance, autonomous weapon systems, and “high-stakes automated decisions (e.g. systems such as ‘social credit’).” The company said that in contrast to other AI companies that have “reduced or removed their safety guardrails and relied primarily on usage policies as their primary safeguards in national security deployments,” OpenAI’s agreement protects its red lines “through a more expansive, multi-layered approach.” “We retain full discretion over our safety stack, we deploy via cloud, cleared OpenAI personnel are in the loop, and we have strong contractual protections,” the blog said. “This is all in addition to the strong existing protections in U.S. law.” Techcrunch event San Francisco, CA | October 13-15, 2026 The company added, “We don’t know why Anthropic could not reach this deal, and we hope that they and more labs will consider it.” After the post was published, Techdirt’s Mike Masnick claimed that the deal “absolutely does allow for domestic surveillance,” because it says the collection of private data will comply with Executive Order 12333 (along with a number of other laws). Masnick described that order as “how the NSA hides its domestic surveillance by capturing communications by tapping into lines *outside the US* even if it contains info from/on US persons.” In a LinkedIn post , OpenAI’s head of national security partnerships Katrina Mulligan argued that much of the discussion around the contract language assumes “the only thing standing between Americans and the use of AI for mass domestic surveillance and autonomous weapons is a single usage policy provision in a single contract with the Department of War.” “That’s not how any of this works,” Mulligan said, adding, “Deployment architecture matters more than contract language […] By limiting our deployment to cloud API, we can ensure that our models cannot be integrated directly into weapons systems, sensors, or other operational hardware.” Altman also fielded questions about the deal on X, where he admitted it had been rushed and resulted in significant backlash against OpenAI (to the extent that Anthropic’s Claude overtook OpenAI’s ChatGPT in Apple’s App Store on Saturday). So why do it? “We really wanted to de-escalate things, and we thought the deal on offer was good,” Altman said. “If we are right and this does lead to a de-escalation between the [Department of War] and the industry, we will look like geniuses, and a company that took on a lot of pain to do things to help the industry. If not, we will continue to be characterized as […] rushed and uncareful.”",

      "summary": "The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most sensitive pressure points in the global economy. Conflict in Iran could put it at risk indefinitely.",
      "content_text": "The analysis company's Commodities at Sea monitoring also recorded outbound oil and product flows averaging about 20.4 million barrels per day in February to date, slightly below January levelsâ€”evidence that geopolitical tension alone can slow shipments before any physical disruption occurs. \"Hormuz risk is not only about closure but also fleet productivity. If Iran escalates by seizing tankers or using drones to threaten commercial traffic, voyage times and possibly costs for Middle East oil exports would further increase,\" S&P Global CERA analysts said. Multiple shipping companies have already reported that they are avoiding the Strait of Hormuz and expect delays and rescheduling of shipments. What Would Closing the Strait Mean? There is no alternative export system at comparable scale. Saudi Arabia and the UAE operate bypass pipelines, but these cover only a portion of Gulf flows, while Iraq, Kuwait, and Qatar lack meaningful alternatives. If the strait formally closed, most oil exports from the Gulf would be cut off from the world almost immediately. Even if Saudi Arabia and the UAE pushed their alternative pipelines to the limit, analysts say about two-thirds of Gulf exports would still be stuck. LNG markets would also be hit. Qatar, the worldâ€™s largest exporter of liquefied natural gasâ€”a super-cooled form of natural gas shipped by tankerâ€”depends almost entirely on the Strait of Hormuz to export its fuel. If the route were blocked, Asian buyers could lose their key suppliers within days. Asian economies such as Japan, South Korea, China, and India depend heavily on imported LNG to generate electricity. Getting oil from elsewhere, like the Atlantic, would mean longer shipping times and higher costs, potentially pushing prices even higher. How It Could Affect Consumers Historical modeling suggests that sudden loss of Gulf supply could push oil prices sharply higher. If that happens, the effects would likely reach global consumers quickly: higher gas prices, more expensive airline tickets, and rising transport costs that feed into the price of food and goods. Financial markets typically react even before physical shortages appear, with oil futures climbing rising, transport-sector equities weakening, and currencies of major energy exporters strengthening as traders price in the risk of disruption. Strategic petroleum reserves could moderate the shock, but releases take time and cannot fully substitute for Gulf crude grades. Inside the Gulf, stopping exports would quickly strain government finances. Countries such as Iraq, Kuwait, and Qatar rely heavily on oil revenues to fund public spending. If shipments halted, storage facilities could fill rapidly, forcing producers to cut output and lose income. Shipping effects would extend beyond oil. Tanker rerouting, insurance repricing, and naval risk zones tend to raise freight rates across bulk commodities and container shipping, impacting worldwide logistics.

      "content_text": "Honor first teased its “Robot phone” with a movable camera arm earlier this year. Ahead of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, the Chinese company provided more details about the device, including how the robot can respond to different situations without commands. The company said that it is planning to launch this device in the second half of this year. Honor said that the robot also has a “personality” and can respond to you with “head shakes” and can also dance to the beat of music. The company noted that users can talk to the assistant on the phone through text and voice. Honor showed a video of a person asking for apparel suggestions, and the robot nodding or shaking to suggest an outfit. The phone has a 200-megapixel camera on a moving robot three-axis gimbal with stabilization tech. The company said that the camera can smoothly rotate around and capture smooth videos and photos. It also has a Super Steady mode for video capture. The company said the phone can get cinematic shots through its Spinshot feature that makes the robot camera rotate by 90 or 180 degrees. Image Credits: Honor The robotic camera also allows for more fluid video calls that can track you through AI-powered object tracking. The tech is like Apple’s Center Stage on steroids if it works. The company said that it developed its own micro motor to control the robotic camera’s movements. It noted that it used some techniques used in foldable phones to make the camera more sturdy and fit the four-degree-of-freedom gimbal system into the body of a phone. Honor said that it is using the same materials for the robotic arm as the Honor Magic V6’s hinge, with 2800 MPa tensile strength.

      "content_text": "Lil' Fun Langs' Guts I'm still thinking about those lil' fun langs . How do they work? What's inside them? Do I need my pancreas? What if I don't want to normalize my IR? Is laziness a virtue? Haskell-esque languages may look alike, but they differ across many dimensions: Most implementations use standard compilation phases: Lexing : Source → Token stream Parsing : Tokens → Surface AST Desugaring : Surface AST → Core AST Type Inference : Core AST → Typed AST Pattern Match Compile : Typed AST → Case trees Normalization (ANF/K) : Typed AST → Normalized IR Optimization : Normalized IR → Normalized IR Closure Conversion : Normalized IR → Closure-explicit IR Code Generation : Closure IR → Target (asm/bytecode/C/LLVM) Register Allocation : Virtual regs → Physical regs (if native) Runtime System : GC, primitives, entry point Strict vs. Lazy In strict evaluation, arguments are evaluated before being passed to a function. In lazy evaluation, arguments are only evaluated if their value is actually needed; the result is cached, so the work happens at most once. -- lazy eval returns `3` without applying `foo` length [ 1, foo 2, 4 ] Aspect Strict (ML, OCaml) Lazy (Haskell) Normalization ANF / K-normal form STG / thunks required Closure conversion Standard flat closures Closures + thunks + update frames Code generation Straightforward Requires eval/apply or push/enter Memory management Values are always evaluated May contain unevaluated thunks Tail calls Simple (jump) Complex (enters, updates) Debugging Easy (call stack is meaningful) Hard (thunks obscure control flow) Runtime complexity Simpler (~200 LOC C) More complex (~500–2000 LOC C) Strict evaluation is the simple choice. If you want laziness, Peyton Jones's STG machine is the standard approach. MicroHs sidesteps the STG machine by compiling directly to combinatory logic with graph reduction. Lazy evaluation also unlocks infinite collections — you can define an infinite list and consume only what you need. Curried vs. Bland Style Examples Implementation cost Curried Haskell, Ben Lynn, MicroHs Free in combinator backends; native backends need arity analysis to avoid allocating a closure per argument Bland MinCaml, OCaml (internally), Grace, EYG Simpler codegen -- multi-arg functions are just functions that take tuples or multiple params In a curried language, f x y is ((f) x) y : two function applications. If your backend doesn't detect that f always takes two arguments (arity analysis), you pay for a heap allocation on every multi-argument call. Bootstrapped vs. Hosted I tried to teach myself to play the guitar. But I'm a horrible teacher — because I do not know how to play a guitar. — Mitch Hedberg Most compilers are written in an existing language (e.g. C, Rust, Haskell, OCaml) and lean on that host's ecosystem for parsing libraries, build tools, and package management. A bootstrapped compiler compiles itself. You write the compiler in the language it compiles, then use an earlier version of the compiler (or a minimal seed runtime) to build the next version. Your language becomes self-sustaining; the compiler is its own test suite. There are many exemplary self-hosted languages to study: MicroHs is a Haskell compiler that compiles Haskell to combinators. The combinator reducer is implemented in C. The compiler is written in Haskell and can compile itself. Bootstrapping requires only a C compiler -- no pre-existing Haskell installation. Ben Lynn starts with a minimal runtime in C (~350 LOC), then constructs increasingly capable compilers, each written in the subset that the previous one can compile. Each stage is ~100–300 LOC of the language being defined. The total chain is ~2000 LOC + 350 LOC C. C runtime (350 LOC) → compiler₁: lambda calculus + integers → compiler₂: + let, letrec, ADTs → compiler₃: + type inference → compiler₄: + pattern matching → compiler₅: + type classes → ... → compilerₙ: near-Haskell-98 Newt is a dependently typed language whose compiler is written in Newt, targeting JavaScript. It bootstraps by keeping the generated JS checked in. This works best when your target is a high-level runtime (JS, JVM) rather than native code. Interpreted vs. Compiled An interpreter executes the program directly by walking its AST or stepping through bytecode. A compiler translates the program into another language (e.g. x86, C, JS) and lets that target handle execution. Strategy Examples LOC estimate Trade-off Tree-walking interpreter PLZoo poly , Eff, Frank, Grace, 1ML 50–200 Simplest. No codegen, no runtime. Slow (10–100× native) Bytecode VM OCaml (ZINC), Tao, PLZoo miniml 200–500 Middle ground. Portable, reasonable speed. Write ~30–50 instructions Native compilation MinCaml, mlml, AQaml 500–1500 Fast execution, but you own register allocation, calling conventions, ABI Transpile to C Koka, Scrapscript, Chicken, Austral 200–500 Best of both worlds -- portable native speed, C compiler does the hard parts Transpile to JS/Go Newt, SOSML, Borgo 200–400 Web/ecosystem deployment, but you inherit the target's performance model Combinator reduction Ben Lynn, MicroHs 100–300 No closures, no registers. Graph reduction evaluator in C. Simple but slow Lil' fun langs are usually interpreters. Without compilation, you can skip closure conversion, register allocation, and runtime systems. The leap from interpreter to compiler costs ~500–2000 LOC. Nominal vs. Structural Types type Meters = Int type Seconds = Int -- Nominal: Meters ≠ Seconds (different names) -- Structural: Meters = Seconds (same shape) Style Examples Consequence Nominal OCaml, Haskell, Austral Name is identity -- same shape doesn't mean same type Structural EYG, Grace, TypeScript, Simple-sub Shape is identity -- same fields/variants means same type Most ML-family languages are nominal for algebraic data types but structural for records (if implemented). Row polymorphism (EYG, Grace, Koka) is inherently structural -- it acts on \"any record with at least these fields.\" Simple-sub goes further: union and intersection types, with principal inference intact. Pretty vs. Ugly Errors -- Ugly: Error: type mismatch: int vs string -- Pretty: 3 │ let x = 1 + \"hello\" │ ^^^^^^^^ Error: I expected an `int` here, but got a `string`. The left side of `+` is `int`, so the right side must be too. Pretty errors cannot be achieved with a coat of paint. To point at a line/region of code, you must thread source locations through every compiler phase. A minimum viable error system: Source spans on every AST node. Every expression, pattern, and type carries { file, start_line, start_col, end_line, end_col } . This costs one extra field per node. Preserve spans through desugaring. When you lower where to let , the new let node inherits the span of the where . Preserve spans through type inference. When unification fails, you need the spans of both conflicting types. Format errors with context. Show the source line, underline the relevant span, explain the mismatch. Quality Examples Cost Elm-tier Elm, Austral Purpose-built error messages per failure mode. Highest effort, best UX Good enough Tao, Ante, OCaml Source spans + generic formatting. Covers 90% of cases Positional MinCaml, most small compilers Line numbers but no span highlighting or explanation De Bruijn indices Elaboration Zoo (intentionally) Variable names lost -- fine for research, bad for users Lexing Approach Used by LOC estimate Notes Hand-written recursive MinCaml (Rust port), Tao, Ante 100–300 Full control, best errors ocamllex / mlllex MinCaml (original), HaMLet, PLZoo 50–100 Standard for OCaml/SML hosts Alex (Haskell) MicroHs, many Haskell-hosted 50–100 Standard for Haskell hosts Parser combinator (integrated) Ben Lynn, some educational 0 (part of parser) Lexerless parsing Optional enhancements: Layout/indentation sensitivity (Haskell-style offside rule): Ben Lynn implements this in later bootstrapping stages. MicroHs includes full layout parsing. Adds 100–300 LOC. The algorithm is well-described by the Haskell Report's Section 2.7 . Unicode identifiers : Most small compilers skip this entirely. Koka supports it. Interpolated strings : Syntax like \"hello ${name}\" is not standard in ML-family, but some newer languages add it. Parsing Parsing converts the flat token stream into a tree. The surface syntax is parsed into a concrete syntax tree (CST) or directly into an abstract syntax tree (AST). ML-family languages have a well-behaved grammar that is almost LL(1) . Approach Used by LOC estimate Notes Recursive descent + Pratt/precedence climbing MinCaml (Rust port), Tao, Ante 200–500 Best error messages, easiest to extend ocamlyacc / mlyacc (LALR) MinCaml (original), HaMLet 100–200 (grammar file) Standard, but poor error recovery Parser combinators (Parsec-style) Ben Lynn, MicroHs, PLZoo 100–400 Elegant, compositional, backtracking PEG / Packrat Rare in ML-family 100–300 Linear time guarantee Every subsequent phase transforms this type. In ML-family languages, the AST typically looks like: type expr = | Lit of literal (* 42, 3.14, \"hello\", true *) | Var of name (* x *) | App of expr * expr (* f x *) | Lam of name * expr (* fun x -> e *) (or \\x -> e) | Let of name * expr * expr (* let x = e1 in e2 *) | LetRec of name * expr * expr (* let rec f = e1 in e2 *) | If of expr * expr * expr (* if c then t else f *) | Tuple of expr list (* (a, b, c) *) | Match of expr * branch list (* match e with p1 -> e1 | ... *) | Ann of expr * type (* (e : t) *) Name Resolution & Desugaring Before type inference, the surface AST is simplified: Alpha-renaming : Every binder is assigned a unique identifier to eliminate shadowing. MinCaml's Rust port does this during type checking. Most do this while parsing or during a separate pass. Fixity resolution : Infix operators are re-associated according to declared precedence and associativity. HaMLet does this as a separate pass. Many small compilers hardcode operator precedence in the parser. Desugaring : Surface constructs are lowered into core constructs: where clauses → let Guards in pattern matching → nested if do notation (monadic) → >>= chains List comprehensions → concatMap Operator sections → lambdas: (+ 1) becomes fun x -> x + 1 Record syntax → positional constructors + accessor functions Type class instances → dictionary passing (elaboration) Type Inference This is the heart of an ML-family language. The \"standard\" algorithm is Hindley-Milner (HM) type inference, specifically Algorithm W or Algorithm J . Core components: Type representation : Types are terms built from type variables, type constructors, and function arrows: type ty = TVar of tvar | TCon of string | TArr of ty * ty | TTuple of ty list Unification : Given two types, find the most general substitution that makes them equal. Implemented as a union-find structure over type variables with occurs-check . Generalization : At let boundaries, free type variables in a type are universally quantified to produce a polymorphic type scheme: ∀α. α → α . Instantiation : When a polymorphic name is used, its scheme is instantiated with fresh type variables. -- Given: let id = fun x -> x in (id 1, id true) -- Type inference trace: -- 1. id : α → α (infer: x has fresh type α, body is x) -- 2. generalize: id : ∀α. α → α (α is free at let boundary) -- 3. id 1: instantiate α=β, unify β→β with int→γ, get int -- 4. id true: instantiate α=δ, unify δ→δ with bool→ε, get bool -- 5. result: (int, bool) Approach Used by LOC estimate Notes Algorithm W (substitution-based) Algorithm W Step-by-Step, PLZoo 150–400 Simplest to understand, compose substitutions eagerly Algorithm J (mutable refs) MinCaml, most production compilers 100–300 More efficient, uses mutable unification variables Constraint-based (HM(X)) GHC, some research compilers 500–2000 Separates constraint generation from solving; extensible Bidirectional type checking Elaboration Zoo, some dependent type systems 200–500 Alternates checking/inference modes; scales to dependent types But fancy type system features aren't free: Enhancement Complexity added Used by Type classes / traits +500–2000 LOC Haskell, MicroHs, Ben Lynn (later stages), Tao Row polymorphism (extensible records/variants) +300–800 LOC Koka, 1ML, EYG, Grace Higher-kinded types +200–500 LOC Haskell, Koka GADTs +500–1500 LOC GHC, OCaml 4.x+ Algebraic effects (typed) +500–1500 LOC Koka, Eff, Frank Dependent types (full) +1000–5000 LOC Elaboration Zoo, Idris, Lean Algebraic subtyping (union/intersection) +500 LOC Simple-sub, MLscript First-class polymorphism (System F) +300–1000 LOC 1ML, MLF Module system (functors, signatures) +1000–5000 LOC HaMLet, OCaml, 1ML Other strategies: Polymorphism: Monomorphic type inference only (no ∀ quantification). Every type is fully determined. This cuts the type checker to ~100 LOC by eliminating generalization and instantiation entirely. Functions like id x = x get a concrete type at each use site. Elaboration: Modern type checkers increasingly separate elaboration (translating surface syntax to a fully explicit core) from unification (solving type constraints). The Elaboration Zoo demonstrates this cleanly: each stage is a single Haskell file of 200–800 LOC, progressively adding features. Type class desugaring via dictionary passing: Haskell-style type classes are implemented by translating class constraints into explicit dictionary arguments. sort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] becomes sort :: OrdDict a -> [a] -> [a] . Ben Lynn's compiler and MicroHs both use this approach. Pattern Match Compilation With types inferred, pattern matching can be compiled to efficient decision trees or case trees. Approach Used by LOC estimate Notes Decision trees (Maranget's algorithm) Most modern compilers, Tao, Ante 200–600 Optimal -- no redundant tests, good code Backtracking automata Older compilers, simple implementations 100–300 Simpler but can duplicate work Nested if/switch (naive) Many educational compilers 50–100 Correct but exponentially bad in worst case Omitted entirely MinCaml, PLZoo poly 0 Only supports if/then/else on primitives Defunctionalized Some educational compilers 50–150 Sequence of partial functions with fallthrough; simpler but less efficient Key phases: Exhaustiveness checking : Warn/error if a match doesn't cover all cases. Redundancy checking : Warn if a pattern is unreachable. Guard compilation : Guards add a \"backtrack\" obligation. Nested pattern flattening : (Cons (x, Cons (y, Nil))) → sequence of tests. The canonical reference is Compiling Pattern Matching to Good Decision Trees . Luc Maranget's algorithm produces provably optimal decision trees in terms of the number of tests. OCaml and Rust use this approach. Normalization -- Before (nested expression): f (g x) (h y) -- After (A-normal form): let a = g x in let b = h y in f a b Every intermediate value gets a name. Every function argument becomes trivial. Evaluation order is now explicit in the let chain. Normalization strategies: Strategy Used by Character K-normal form (MinCaml's variant of ANF) MinCaml and derivatives Direct-style; names all intermediate values with let A-normal form (ANF) Flanagan et al. 1993, many modern compilers Essentially the same as K-normal form; the standard name Continuation-passing style (CPS) Appel's SML/NJ, Rabbit, CertiCoq Every function takes an extra continuation argument; all calls are tail calls No normalization Ben Lynn Typed AST → combinatory logic directly. Works for graph reduction, not for native codegen SSA directly Scrapscript Skips ANF/CPS; SSA IR with SCCP + DCE. Lets LLVM/C handle the rest Monadic normal form Some dependent type systems (Bowman, 2024) Like ANF but uses monadic bind instead of let; cleaner for certain optimizations Optimization With the program in normal form, optimization passes can simplify it. In small compilers, optimizations are kept minimal -- the goal is to not be embarrassingly slow, not to compete with GCC. MinCaml's optimization passes (totaling ~300 LOC): Pass LOC (MinCaml) Effect Beta reduction ~",

The Chinese company has been obsessed with proving that it makes the thinnest foldables. This year’s version is 4mm thick when unfolded and 8.75 mm thick when folded. Compared to last year’s Magic V5 , which was 4.1 mm thick when unfolded and 8.8 mm thick when folded. We are talking very thin shavings here, but that helps the company make those claims.

What’s more, Honor also showed a new Silicon-carbon battery tech with 32% silicon density that could push foldable phone battery over 7,000 mAh. The new device has a 7.95-inch main AMOLED display with 2352 x 2172 pixel resolution and a 6.52-inch cover display with 2420 x 1080 pixel resolution. Both screens support LTPO 2.0, which means they can switch to variable refresh rates between 1-120Hz for different use cases for better content legibility and power saving. The company said that it has worked on a new Super Steel Hinge with a tensile strength of 2,800 MPa, which would make for sturdy long-term usage. It also said that it has reduced the crease depth by 44%, making the display look smooth. Honor noted that the Magic V6 has a new anti-reflective coating for the external screen with a reflectivity rating of 1.5%. The phone is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor, has 16GB RAM, and 512GB of storage. The Magic V6 has three rear cameras: a 50-megapixel main camera with f/1.6 aperture, a 64-megapixel telephoto camera with f/2.5 aperture, and a 50-megapixel ultrawide camera with f/2.2 aperture. On the front, there are dual 20-megapixel cameras with an f/2.2 aperture. Techcrunch event San Francisco, CA | October 13-15, 2026 Honor is taking efforts to make the device have file and notification sharing compatibility with Apple devices. For instance, with Honor Magic V6, you can set up a two-way notification sync with an iPhone. Plus, the device also has settings to display notifications on the Apple Watch. The foldable has the ability share files with Macs with one tap, and it can act as an extended display as well. Honor didn’t specify pricing for the device, but said that the Magic V6 will be released in select international markets in the second half of the year.",

      "content_text": "Researchers at Oregon State University have created a new nanomaterial designed to destroy cancer cells from the inside. The material activates two separate chemical reactions once inside a tumor cell, overwhelming it with oxidative stress while leaving surrounding healthy tissue unharmed. The work, led by Oleh Taratula, Olena Taratula, and Chao Wang from the OSU College of Pharmacy, was published in Advanced Functional Materials . Advancing Chemodynamic Therapy The discovery strengthens the growing field of chemodynamic therapy or CDT. This emerging cancer treatment strategy takes advantage of the unique chemical conditions found inside tumors. Compared with normal tissue, cancer cells tend to be more acidic and contain higher levels of hydrogen peroxide. Traditional CDT uses these tumor conditions to spark the formation of hydroxyl radicals, highly reactive molecules made of oxygen and hydrogen that contain an unpaired electron. These reactive oxygen species damage cells through oxidation, stripping electrons from essential components such as lipids, proteins, and DNA. More recent CDT approaches have also succeeded in generating singlet oxygen inside tumors. Singlet oxygen is another reactive oxygen species, named for its single electron spin state rather than the three spin states seen in the more stable oxygen molecules present in the air. Overcoming Limits of Existing CDT Agents \"However, existing CDT agents are limited,\" Oleh Taratula said. \"They efficiently generate either radical hydroxyls or singlet oxygen but not both, and they often lack sufficient catalytic activity to sustain robust reactive oxygen species production. Consequently, preclinical studies often only show partial tumor regression and not a durable therapeutic benefit.\" To address these shortcomings, the team developed a new CDT nanoagent built from an iron-based metal-organic framework or MOF. This structure is capable of producing both hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen, increasing its cancer-fighting potential. The MOF demonstrated strong toxicity across multiple cancer cell lines while causing minimal harm to noncancerous cells. Complete Tumor Regression in Mice \"When we systemically administered our nanoagent in mice bearing human breast cancer cells, it efficiently accumulated in tumors, robustly generated reactive oxygen species and completely eradicated the cancer without adverse effects,\" Olena Taratula said. \"We saw total tumor regression and long-term prevention of recurrence, all without seeing any systemic toxicity.\" In these preclinical experiments, tumors disappeared entirely and did not return, and the animals showed no signs of harmful side effects. Next Steps Toward Broader Cancer Treatment Before moving into human trials, the researchers plan to test the treatment in additional cancer types, including aggressive pancreatic cancer, to determine whether the approach can be effective across a wide range of tumors. Other contributors to the study included Oregon State researchers Kongbrailatpam Shitaljit Sharma, Yoon Tae Goo, Vladislav Grigoriev, Constanze Raitmayr, Ana Paula Mesquita Souza, and Manali Parag Phawde. Funding was provided by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.",

      "content_text": "We finally have an update to the Soundcore Space One that launched two and a half years ago. At MWC 2026, Soundcore has announced the Space 2, which will be available in the US on April 21st in three colors — linen white, jet black, and seafoam green — for $129.99. That’s $30 more than the Space One’s original price. According to Soundcore, the Space 2 have had a full-band noise cancellation upgrade with the focus of those improvements on the low-frequency sounds we all generally use ANC headphones to block — things like airplane, train, and bus engine sounds while traveling. The Space 2 use the same number of microphones as the Space One for noise canceling, instead relying on optimized mic placement and structure and materials improvements for the boost in performance. Redesigned 40mm drivers incorporate dual layers in their design. There’s a silk diaphragm with metal ceramic that supposedly results in faster transient response — the driver’s ability to respond to sudden sound quickly and accurately — with better balanced sound reproduction. The Space One had great sound performance for the price, but I’m all for any improvement to sound performance accuracy. Like the Space One, the Space 2 will support LDAC high-res audio. The headphones connect wirelessly over Bluetooth 6.1, although they do not support Auracast transmissions — an unfortunate exclusion. There’s also a 3.5mm jack for a wired connection. Battery life has been increased to up to 50 hours with ANC and 70 hours with ANC off. This is up from 40 hours with ANC and 55 hours without ANC with the Space One headphones. With a five-minute charge the Space 2 get an additional four hours of listening. The Space 2 will include many of the features found on the Space One. You can use HearID 3.0 to go through a series of sound samples to tune the headphones’ sound to your preferences. It worked well for me on the Space One to get them closer to a sound I liked, with a bit of the edge taken off the higher frequencies. There’s also a sensor that detects when you remove the headphones and stops playback so you don’t miss any of your music or podcast. They once again come with a cloth bag that matches the color of the headphones instead of a case, which is one change I wish Soundcore had made, as the cloth bag doesn’t offer as much protection if you tend to throw your headphones into your backpack or bag. The Soundcore Space One were among the best budget ANC headphones when they came out, and still hold up to more recent releases. But with the bump in price to over $100 for the Space 2, there’s a bit more expectation on them. ANC performance continues to improve — and products get cheaper — across manufacturers, so the Soundcore Space 2 has some competition from companies like Sony, EarFun, and JLab. If the ANC on the Space 2 stands up to current budget headphones and they still sound as good and are as comfortable as the Space One, you can expect to see the new Soundcore Space 2 on many recommendation lists.",

As first reported by CNBC , Claude has been rising to the top of the free app rankings in Apple’s US App Store. On Saturday evening, it overtook OpenAI’s ChatGPT to claim the number one spot, a position that it still held on Sunday morning. According to data from SensorTower , Claude was just outside the top 100 at the end of January, and has spent most of February somewhere in the top 20. It’s climbed rapidly in the past few days, from sixth on Wednesday, then fourth on Thursday, then first on Saturday. A company spokesperson said that daily signups have broken the all-time record every day this week, free users have increased more than 60% since January, and paid subscribers have more than doubled this year. After Anthropic attempted to negotiate for safeguards preventing the Department of Defense from using its AI models for mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons, President Donald Trump directed federal agencies to stop using all Anthropic products and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said he’s designating the company a supply-chain threat . OpenAI subsequently announced its own agreement with the Pentagon , which CEO Sam Altman claimed includes safeguards related to domestic surveillance and autonomous weapons. This post was first published on February 28, 2026. It has been updated to reflect Anthropic reaching No. 1, and to include growth numbers from the company.

Specs are still thin on the ground, but the company has confirmed it plans to release the phone in the second half of this year — though I’ve been told that will only be in China. The Robot Phone doesn’t quite live up to the name — really it’s a smartphone with a gimbal-stabilized camera arm crammed into the back. Honor has now revealed that the main camera will have a 200-megapixel sensor, and is built into what it says is the smallest 4DoF gimbal system in the industry, though those are all the official specs we have so far. It includes various AI camera tracking modes, along with more robotic features like the ability to nod or shake its head in conversation, and “dance” to music. I fought through a throng of journalists to see a working unit in the demo area, which I saw unfold from the device, hold an AI-enabled conversation, and fold back in. So I can confirm it moves, but I didn’t get to see the rest of its capabilities — still, that’s more than I saw at CES . Honor showed the Robot Phone off on stage together with a diminutive humanoid robot. It gave no details at all about that device, though has previously claimed it does have plans for a commercial launch. The robot danced and backflipped across the stage — though whether or not it was under teleoperation, Honor wouldn’t say. I later saw it haltingly wave and shake hands with press in a demo area, though did that inconsistently enough that I’m confident it wasn’t under remote control. I’ll be seeing more of both the robot and Robot Phone on the MWC floor tomorrow, when I should get a better idea of what to expect from Honor’s robotics plans.

      "content_text": "Yes, writing code is easier than ever. AI assistants autocomplete your functions. Agents scaffold entire features. You can describe what you want in plain English and watch working code appear in seconds. The barrier to producing code has never been lower. And yet, the day-to-day life of software engineers has gotten more complex, more demanding, and more exhausting than it was two years ago. This is not a contradiction. It is the reality of what happens when an industry adopts a powerful new tool without pausing to consider the second-order effects on the people using it. If you are a software engineer reading this and feeling like your job quietly became harder while everyone around you celebrates how easy everything is now, you are not imagining things. The job changed. The expectations changed. And nobody sent a memo. The Baseline Moved and Nobody Told You There is a phenomenon happening right now that most engineers feel but struggle to articulate. The expected output of a software engineer in 2026 is dramatically higher than it was in 2023. Not because anyone held a meeting and announced new targets. Not because your manager sat you down and explained the new rules. The baseline just moved. It moved because AI tools made certain tasks faster. And when tasks become faster, the assumption follows immediately: you should be doing more. Not in the future. Now. A February 2026 study published in Harvard Business Review tracked 200 employees at a U.S. tech company over eight months. The researchers found something that will sound familiar to anyone living through this shift. Workers did not use AI to finish earlier and go home. They used it to do more. They took on broader tasks, worked at a faster pace, and extended their hours, often without anyone asking them to. The researchers described a self-reinforcing cycle: AI accelerated certain tasks, which raised expectations for speed. Higher speed made workers more reliant on AI. Increased reliance widened the scope of what workers attempted. And a wider scope further expanded the quantity and density of work. The numbers tell the rest of the story. Eighty-three percent of workers in the study said AI increased their workload. Burnout was reported by 62 percent of associates and 61 percent of entry-level workers. Among C-suite leaders? Just 38 percent. The people doing the actual work are carrying the intensity. The people setting the expectations are not feeling it the same way. This gap matters enormously. If leadership believes AI is making everything easier while engineers are drowning in a new kind of complexity, the result is a slow erosion of trust, morale, and eventually talent. A separate survey of over 600 engineering professionals found that nearly two-thirds of engineers experience burnout despite their organizations using AI in development. Forty-three percent said leadership was out of touch with team challenges. Over a third reported that productivity had actually decreased over the past year, even as their companies invested more in AI tooling. The baseline moved. The expectations rose. And for many engineers, no one acknowledged that the job they signed up for had fundamentally changed. The Identity Crisis Nobody Talks About Here is something that gets lost in all the excitement about AI productivity: most software engineers became engineers because they love writing code. Not managing code. Not reviewing code. Not supervising systems that produce code. Writing it. The act of thinking through a problem, designing a solution, and expressing it precisely in a language that makes a machine do exactly what you intended. That is what drew most of us to this profession. It is a creative act, a form of craftsmanship, and for many engineers, the most satisfying part of their day. Now they are being told to stop. Not explicitly, of course. Nobody walks into a standup and says “stop writing code.” But the message is there, subtle and persistent. Use AI to write it faster. Let the agent handle the implementation. Focus on higher-level tasks. Your value is not in the code you write anymore, it is in how well you direct the systems that write it for you. For early adopters, this feels exciting. It feels like evolution. For a significant portion of working engineers, it feels like being told that the thing they spent years mastering, the skill that defines their professional identity, is suddenly less important. One engineer captured this shift perfectly in a widely shared essay, describing how AI transformed the engineering role from builder to reviewer. Every day felt like being a judge on an assembly line that never stops. You just keep stamping those pull requests. The production volume went up. The sense of craftsmanship went down. This is not a minor adjustment. It is a fundamental shift in professional identity. Engineers who built their careers around deep technical skill are being asked to redefine what they do and who they are, essentially overnight, without any transition period, training, or acknowledgment that something significant was lost in the process. Having led engineering teams for over two decades, I have seen technology shifts before. New frameworks, new languages, new methodologies. Engineers adapt. They always have. But this is different because it is not asking engineers to learn a new way of doing what they do. It is asking them to stop doing the thing that made them engineers in the first place and become something else entirely. That is not an upgrade. That is a career identity crisis. And pretending it is not happening does not make it go away. The Expanding Role: When Everything Becomes Your Problem While engineers are being asked to write less code, they are simultaneously being asked to do more of everything else. More product thinking. More architectural decision-making. More code review. More context switching. More planning. More testing oversight. More deployment awareness. More risk assessment. The scope of what it means to be a “software engineer” expanded dramatically in the last two years, and it happened without a pause to catch up. This is partly a direct consequence of AI acceleration. When code gets produced faster, the bottleneck shifts. It moves from implementation to everything surrounding implementation: requirements clarity, architecture decisions, integration testing, deployment strategy, monitoring, and maintenance. These were always part of the engineering lifecycle, but they were distributed across roles. Product managers handled requirements. QA handled testing. DevOps handled deployment. Senior architects handled system design. Now, with AI collapsing the implementation phase, organizations are quietly redistributing those responsibilities to the engineers themselves. The Harvard Business Review study documented this exact pattern. Product managers began writing code. Engineers took on product work. Researchers started doing engineering tasks. Roles that once had clear boundaries blurred as workers used AI to handle jobs that previously sat outside their remit. The industry is openly talking about this as a positive development. Engineers should be “T-shaped” or “full-stack” in a broader sense. Nearly 45 percent of engineering roles now expect proficiency across multiple domains. AI tools augment generalists more effectively, making it easier for one person to handle multiple components of a system. On paper, this sounds empowering. In practice, it means that a mid-level backend engineer is now expected to understand product strategy, review AI-generated frontend code they did not write, think about deployment infrastructure, consider security implications of code they cannot fully trace, and maintain a big-picture architectural awareness that used to be someone else’s job. That is not empowerment. That is scope creep without a corresponding increase in compensation, authority, or time. From my experience building and scaling teams in fintech and high-traffic platforms, I can tell you that role expansion without clear boundaries always leads to the same outcome: people try to do everything, nothing gets done with the depth it requires, and burnout follows. The engineers who survive are the ones who learn to say no, to prioritize ruthlessly, and to push back when the scope of their role quietly doubles without anyone acknowledging it. The Supervision Paradox There is an irony at the center of the AI-assisted engineering workflow that nobody wants to talk about: reviewing AI-generated code is often harder than writing the code yourself. When you write code, you carry the context of every decision in your head. You know why you chose this data structure, why you handled this edge case, why you structured the module this way. The code is an expression of your thinking, and reviewing it later is straightforward because the reasoning is already stored in your memory. When AI writes code, you inherit the output without the reasoning. You see the code, but you do not see the decisions. You do not know what tradeoffs were made, what assumptions were baked in, what edge cases were considered or ignored. You are reviewing someone else’s work, except that someone is not a colleague you can ask questions. It is a statistical model that produces plausible-looking code without any understanding of your system’s specific constraints. A survey by Harness found that 67 percent of developers reported spending more time debugging AI-generated code, and 68 percent spent more time reviewing it than they did with human-written code. This is not a failure of the tools. It is a structural property of the workflow. Code review without shared context is inherently more demanding than reviewing code you participated in creating. Yet the expectation from management is that AI should be making everything faster. So engineers find themselves in a bind: they are producing more code than ever, but the quality assurance burden has increased, the context-per-line-of-code has decreased, and the cognitive load of maintaining a system they only partially built is growing with every sprint. This is the supervision paradox. The faster AI generates code, the more human attention is required to ensure that code actually works in the context of a real system with real users and real business constraints. The production bottleneck did not disappear. It moved from writing to understanding, and understanding is harder to speed up. The Acceleration Trap What makes all of this especially difficult is the self-reinforcing nature of the cycle. AI makes certain tasks faster. Faster tasks create the perception of more available capacity. More perceived capacity leads to more work being assigned. More work leads to more AI reliance. More AI reliance leads to more code that needs review, more context that needs to be maintained, more systems that need to be understood, and more cognitive load on engineers who are already stretched thin. The Harvard Business Review researchers described this as “workload creep.” Workers did not consciously decide to work harder. The expansion happened naturally, almost invisibly. Each individual step felt reasonable. In aggregate, it produced an unsustainable pace. Before AI, there was a natural ceiling on how much you could produce in a day. That ceiling was set by thinking speed, typing speed, and the time it takes to look things up. It was frustrating sometimes, but it was also a governor. A natural speed limit that prevented you from outrunning your own ability to maintain quality. AI removed the governor. Now the only limit is your cognitive endurance. And most people do not know their cognitive limits until they have already blown past them. This is where many engineers find themselves right now. Shipping more code than any quarter in their career. Feeling more drained than any quarter in their career. The two facts are not unrelated. The trap is that it looks like productivity from the outside. Metrics go up. Velocity charts look great. More features shipped. More pull requests merged. But underneath the numbers, quality is quietly eroding, technical debt is accumulating faster than it can be addressed, and the people doing the work are running on fumes. What Junior Engineers Are Facing If the picture is difficult for experienced engineers, it is even harder for those starting their careers. Junior engineers have traditionally learned by doing the simpler, more task-oriented work. Fixing small bugs. Writing straightforward features. Implementing well-defined tickets. This hands-on work built the foundational understanding that eventually allowed them to take on more complex challenges. AI is rapidly consuming that training ground. If an agent can handle the routine API hookup, the boilerplate module, the straightforward CRUD endpoint, what is left for a junior engineer to learn from? The expectation is shifting toward needing to contribute at a higher level almost from day one, without the gradual ramp-up that previous generations of engineers relied on. Entry-level hiring at the 15 largest tech firms fell 25 percent from 2023 to 2024. The HackerRank 2025 Developer Skills Report confirmed that expectations are rising faster than productivity gains, and that early-career hiring remains sluggish compared to senior-level roles. Companies are prioritizing experienced talent, but the pipeline that produces experienced talent is being quietly dismantled. This is a problem that extends beyond individual career concerns. If junior engineers do not get the opportunity to build foundational skills through hands-on work, the industry will eventually face a shortage of senior engineers who truly understand the systems they oversee. You cannot supervise what you never learned to build. As I have written before, code is for humans to read. If the next generation of engineers never develops the fluency to read, understand, and reason about code at a deep level, no amount of AI tooling will compensate for that gap. What Good Leadership Looks Like Right Now If you lead engineering teams, the most important thing you can do right now is acknowledge that this transition is genuinely difficult. Not theoretically. Not abstractly. For the actual people on your team. The career they signed up for changed fast. The skills they were hired for are being repositioned. The expectations they are working under shifted without a clear announcement. Acknowledging this reality is not a sign of weakness. It is a prerequisite for maintaining a team that trusts you. Start with empathy, but do not stop there. Give your team real training. Not a lunch-and-learn about prompt engineering. Real investment in the skills that the new engineering landscape actually requires: system design, architectural thinking, product reasoning, security awareness, and the ability to critically evaluate code they did not write. These are not trivial skills. They take time to develop, and your team needs structured support to build them. Give them space to experiment without the pressure of immediate productivity gains. The engineers who will thrive in this environment are the ones who have room to figure out how AI fits into their workflow without being penalized for the learning curve. Every experienced technologist I know who has successfully integrated AI tools went through an adjustment period where they were less productive before they became more productive. That adjustment period is normal, and it needs to be protected. Set explicit boundaries around role scope. If you are asking engineers to take on product thinking, planning, and risk assessment in addition to their technical work, name it. Define it. Compensate for it. Do not let it happen silently and then wonder why your team is burned out. Rethink your metrics. If your engineering success metrics are still centered on velocity, tickets closed, and lines of code, you are measuring the wrong thin",

      "content_text": "Ape coding is a software development practice where a human developer deliberately hand-writes source code. Practitioners of ape coding will typically author code by typing it on a computer keyboard, using specifically designed text editing software. History The term was popularized when agentic coding (coding performed by AI agents) became the dominant form of software development. Ape coding first appeared in programming communities as derogatory slang, referring to developers who were unable to program with agents. Despite the quick spread of agentic coding, institutional inertia, affordability, and limitations in human neuroplasticity were barriers to universal adoption of the new technology. Critics of agentic coding reappropriated the term during a period of pushback against society’s growing reliance on AI. Effective use of the primitive AIs available at the time demanded a high level of expertise, which wasn’t evenly distributed in organizations. As a result, regressions in software products and disruptions in electronic services were frequent within the first stages of adoption. Ironic usage of ape coding as a positive description became commonplace. It highlighted a more deliberate approach to building software: one defined by manual craftsmanship, requiring direct and continuous human involvement. Rationale The central view of ape coding proponents was that software engineered by AIs did not match the reliability of software engineered by humans, and should not be deployed to production environments. A recurring argument in favor of this perspective was based on comprehensibility. The volume of code AI developers could produce on demand was much larger than what human developers were able to produce and understand in a similar timeframe. Large and intricate codebases that would take an experienced human engineer months or years to grasp could be produced in hours. The escalating complexity of such codebases hindered efforts in software testing and quality assurance. AI skepticism also played a part in the critique of agentic coding. There was widespread speculation on whether the nascent AIs of the period possessed true understanding of the tasks they were given. Furthermore, early AI implementations had deficiencies related to context length, memory, and continual learning, affecting quality and consistency of output. Other defenses of ape coding reflected concerns about the impact of AI on labor markets. Despite the shortcomings of AI-written software, human developers were increasingly replaced by agents, with examples of high profile companies laying off large portions of their IT staff. Tangentially, the responsibilities of human software engineers shifted when an essential aspect of their work (coding) was automated. The activities that remained were more similar to management, QA, and in some cases assistant roles. A common observation was that the human engineers who were still employed no longer enjoyed their line of work. Advocacy for human-written software Ape coding advocates argued that a return to human-written software would resolve the issues introduced by AI software development. Interest groups campaigned for restrictions on agentic coding, subsidies for AI-free software companies, quotas for human developers, and other initiatives in the same vein. Although ape coding advocacy enjoyed a brief moment of popular support, none of these objectives were ever achieved. Decline Advances in AI quickly turned ape coding into an antiquated practice. Technical arguments for ape coding did not apply to newer generations of AI software engineers, and political arguments were seen as a form of neo-Luddism. Once virtually all software engineering was handed over to AIs, the concept of ape coding fell into obscurity. Revival and modern practice A resurgence of interest in ape coding has revived the practice among human hobbyists. Communities and subcommunities have formed where ape coders—as they came to be known—discuss computer science topics, including programming languages and software engineering. Prominent ape coding clubs have attracted hundreds of thousands of members who exchange ideas and human-written programs. The clubs organize in-person as well as virtual gatherings where teams of ape coders collaborate on software projects. The main value of modern ape coding appears to be recreational. Ape coders manifest high levels of engagement during coding sessions and report feelings of relaxation after succeeding in (self-imposed) coding challenges. Competitive ape coding is also popular, with top ranked ape coders being relatively well-known in their communities. Aside from recreation, humans pursue ape coding for its educational value. Many have described ape coding as a way to gain a deeper understanding of the world around them. While an interest in ape coding was initially perceived as an unusual quirk, it is currently seen as a positive trait in human society, signaling curiosity. Current trends Members of the software archaeology community published a series of articles on the human-written Linux kernel that had a deep impact in the larger ape coding world. Considered by ape coders to be the ultimate work of human software engineers (in scale, complexity, and longevity), Linux inspired a wave of initiatives to build large scale software projects featuring thousands of human collaborators. The most promising of these efforts is based on studies by the AI-written software interpretability community. The goal is to produce an entirely human-written compiler for the AI-designed programming language 𒀯. A fully compliant implementation is estimated to be many times as complex as the Linux kernel, but a prototype with limited scope is within human capabilities and is currently the primary focus of enthusiasts. Results so far have been encouraging, as the latest version of h-𒀯 is able to build functional binaries for small programs. However, the initiative has recently suffered a setback as core contributors to its codebase left to work on a fork. The split was motivated by heated debates on whether C is the most suitable programming language for the project; dissenters expressed a desire to rewrite it in Rust.

      "summary": "What's behind the SaaSpocalypse? It simply seems a new supreme has risen.",
      "content_text": "One day not long ago, a founder texted his investor with an update: he was replacing his entire customer service team with Claude Code, an AI tool that can write and deploy software on its own. To Lex Zhao, an investor at One Way Ventures, the message indicated something bigger — the moment when companies like Salesforce stopped being the automatic default. “The barriers to entry for creating software are so low now thanks to coding agents, that the build versus buy decision is shifting toward build in so many cases,” Zhao told TechCrunch. The build versus buy shift is only part of the problem. The whole idea of using AI agents instead of people to perform work throws into question the SaaS business model itself. SaaS companies currently price their software per seat — meaning by how many employees log in to use it. “SaaS has long been regarded as one of the most attractive business models due to its highly predictable recurring revenue, immense scalability, and 70-90% gross margins,” Abdul Abdirahman, an investor at the venture firm F-Prime, told TechCrunch. When one, or a handful, of AI agents can do that work — when employees simply ask their AI of choice to pull the data from the system — that per-seat model starts to break down. The rapid pace of AI development also means that new tools, like Claude Code or OpenAI’s Codex, can replicate not just the core functions of SaaS products but also the add-on tools a SaaS vendor would sell to grow revenue from existing customers. On top of that, customers now have the ultimate contract negotiation tool in their pockets: If they don’t like a SaaS vendor’s prices, they can, more easily than ever before, build their own alternative. “Even if they do not take the build route, this creates downward pressure on contracts that SaaS vendors can secure during renewals,” Abdirahman continued. We saw this as early as late 2024, when Klarna announced that it had ditched Salesforce’s flagship CRM product in favor of its own homegrown AI system. The realization that a growing number of other companies can do the same is spooking public markets, where the stock prices of SaaS giants like Salesforce and Workday have been sliding. In early February, an investor sell-off wiped nearly $1 trillion in market value from software and services stocks, followed by another billion later in the month. Techcrunch event San Francisco, CA | October 13-15, 2026 Experts are calling it the SaaSpocalypse , with one analyst dubbing it FOBO investing — or fear of becoming obsolete . Yet the venture investors TechCrunch spoke with believe such fears are only temporary. “This isn’t the death of SaaS,” Aaron Holiday, a managing partner at 645 Ventures, told TechCrunch. Rather, it’s the beginning of an old snake shedding its skin, he said. Move fast, break SaaS The public market pattern is best illustrated through Anthropic’s recent product launches. The company released Claude Code for cybersecurity, and related stocks dropped. It released legal tools in Claude Cowork AI, and the stock price of the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF — a basket of publicly traded software companies that includes firms like LegalZoom and RELX — also dropped. In some ways, this was expected, as SaaS companies had long been overvalued, investors said. It also doesn’t help that these companies did the bulk of their growing during the zero-interest-rate era, which has since ended. The cost of doing business rises when the cost of borrowing money increases. Public market investors typically price SaaS companies by estimating future revenue. But there is no telling whether in one year or five years anyone will be using SaaS products to the extent they once did. That’s why every time a new advanced AI tool launches, SaaS stocks feel a tremor. “This may be the first time in history that the terminal value of software is being fundamentally questioned, materially reshaping how SaaS companies are underwritten going forward,” Abdirahman said. That’s because slapping AI features on top of existing SaaS products may not be enough. A horde of AI-native startups is rising at a record pace , having completely redefined what it means to be a software company. Software is now easier and cheaper to build, meaning it’s easier to replicate, Yoni Rechtman, a partner at Slow Ventures, told TechCrunch. That’s good news for the next generation of startups, but bad news for the incumbents that spent years building their tech stacks. On the other hand, the market also lacks enough time and evidence to show that whatever new business model emerges the SaaS’s wake will be worthwhile. AI companies are sometimes pricing their models based on consumption, meaning customers pay based on how much AI they use, measured in tokens (which each model provider defines slightly differently). Others are working on “outcome-based pricing,” where fees are charged based on how well the AI actually works. This, ironically, is the current approach of former Salesforce CEO Bret Taylor’s AI startup, Sierra, a quasi-Salesforce competitor that offers customer service agents. The approach appears, so far, appears to be working. In November, Sierra hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue in less than two years. There was once also the idea that cloud-based software like SaaS sells would never depreciate and that it could last for decades. This is still true in some ways compared to what came before — on-premises software, which companies had to install and maintain on their own servers. But being in the cloud doesn’t protect SaaS vendors from an entirely new technology rising to compete: AI. Investors are rightfully nervous as AI-native companies pop up, adapt, adopt, and build technology much faster than a traditional SaaS company can move. SaaS companies are, after all, themselves the incumbents, having replaced old-school on-premises vendors in the last era of disruption. This SaaSpocalypse calls to mind that Taylor Swift lyric about what happens when “someone else lights up the room” because “people love an ingénue.” “The most important thing to understand about the SaaS pullback is that it is simultaneously a real structural shift and potentially a market overreaction,” Abdirahman said, adding that investors typically “sell first and ask questions later.” SaaS IPOs are on hold Public-market SaaS companies aren’t the only ones feeling a chill from investors. A Crunchbase report released Wednesday showed that, though the IPO market seems to be thawing for some sectors , there haven’t been — and aren’t expected to be — any venture-backed SaaS filings on the horizon. Holiday said this may be because there is a lot of pressure on large, private, late-stage SaaS companies like Canva and Rippling given the persnickety IPO window, high expectations driven by AI advancements, and the unsteady stock price of already public SaaS companies. Some of these companies, including mid-size SaaS companies, have even struggled to raise extension rounds in the private market, Holiday said, over the same fears public investors have. “Nobody wants to be subjected to the volatility of public markets when sentiment can send companies into downward tailspins,” Rechtman said, adding he expects to see companies like these to stay private for much longer. Meanwhile, the public market waits to get a good look at the finances of the first AI-native companies hoping to IPO. The scuttlebutt says that both OpenAI and Anthropic are contemplating IPOs, maybe even later this year. The most likely outcome is something that weaves the old and the new together, as tech disruptions always have. Holiday said most of the new features companies are toying with these days “won’t stick” and that enterprises will always need software that meets compliance regulations, supports audits, manages workflow, and offers durability. “Durable shareholder value isn’t built on hype,” he continued. “It’s built on fundamentals, retention, margins, real budgets, and defensibility.”",

      "content_text": "Resident Evil turns 30 this year. The series is full of history — the new Resident Evil Requiem is technically the ninth mainline game, but there are a bunch of spinoffs, remakes, movies, and even a TV show — which can make it fun to follow for fans. But it’s also intimidating for people like me who haven’t played everything. The latest release, Resident Evil Requiem, tries to appeal to both sides by starring a new character, the cowering FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, and a series favorite, action hero Leon Kennedy. Initially, it really works: the first half of Resident Evil Requiem is one of the freshest horror games I’ve ever played. But as the game goes on, it gets bogged down by Resident Evil ’s past. **Spoilers for Resident Evil Requiem are below.** Grace Ashcroft, the game’s other protagonist. Image: Capcom For much of the first half of Requiem , the balance between the two is close to perfect. Most of the time, you’re playing as Grace, and her limited arsenal means you have to be thoughtful about every step and bullet. I was constantly on edge as I crept through the hallways of a medical care facility, narrowly creeping past horrors like a monster known only as “the girl” and a huge zombie wielding a butcher knife. And despite some connections to past games, Grace’s story stands on its own, meaning I wasn’t worried about lore I had missed while I was also trying to survive. When the game would switch to brief sections in Leon’s perspective, I could take out enemies that I felt powerless against as Grace with relative ease. Leon is more capable in battle than the inexperienced Grace — he’s been through the Resident Evil wringer a few times already — and I felt an immense sense of relief when I was able to kill that butcher knife zombie in a few blasts from my shotgun. But soon enough, I’d be back in Grace’s shoes, experiencing pure terror again and counting the seconds until the game would let me play as Leon for a break from the tension. The game goes back and forth like this until, after an extremely satisfying confrontation with the girl, Grace just leaves with a mysterious new villain character who basically comes out of nowhere, and you’re forced to play as Leon as he tries to track down Grace in Raccoon City. Longtime fans will recognize Raccoon City as one of the main settings in the series; Leon stars as a rookie cop for the city in Resident Evil 2 , and it was eventually destroyed by a nuclear bomb to contain a zombie virus. In Requiem , you spend an extensive amount of time exploring the drab wasteland that Raccoon City has become, including the ruins of the police station where Leon got his start. But without the push-pull of switching between Grace and Leon, the game starts to drag like an overly long action movie. There were also some nods to previous games, like Leon commenting on a puzzle he once solved, and while they might work for those who know the Resident Evil series inside and out, they were less effective on me. Besides Requiem , I’ve played 7 , Village , and both the original Resident Evil 4 and its remake, so none of this nostalgia hit. It just felt like more stuff to get through on my way to finding Grace again for some actual horror. Requiem’s last main area, a high-tech lab, was a bit more interesting to explore, especially when the game switches between Grace and Leon again. But for a game that sets up Grace as the primary protagonist, I found it disappointing that Leon basically takes over as the main lead, even being the one to fight the final boss. (Which, itself, is a disappointment: a giant plant-like zombie thing with obvious red boils to mindlessly shoot.) It was all a letdown of a back half to what was shaping up to be one of my favorite horror games. Maybe I’d feel differently about Requiem if I had played Resident Evil 2 . But because of Requiem ’s reliance on Leon nostalgia, the game’s dual-character perspective, which started out as its biggest strength, became a weakness by the end.

      "content_text": "This is The Stepback , a weekly newsletter breaking down one essential story from the tech world. For more on the contemporary attention economy, follow Mia Sato . The Stepback arrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 8AM ET. Opt in for The Stepback here . “KING BASEBALL, monarch of the American sport world, is sick,” a New York Times story on the disappearance of amateur and small town sandlots begins. Hundreds of thousands of fans attended the opening games of the season, and star players are making bank in huge stadiums. “Nevertheless the critics say that his Royal Highness is indisposed.” The story is from 1925 . But it reads like it could have been published a hundred years later. “Baseball is dying” is a perennial claim that feels like (literally) old news — but by the numbers there’s truth to it. World Series viewership is far from its peak decades ago. Attendance at ballparks hasn’t yet matched 2007 numbers. Even with viewership and attendance on the upswing, baseball is dwarfed by football, both in sheer audience numbers and in the American imagination . A few years ago, recognizing that games were dragging on and on to their detriment, MLB implemented a pitch clock to speed things up; this season, the league will have an automated system calling balls and strikes , dubbed “robot umps,” at home plate when a player challenges the human umpire’s call. But MLB is going into the 2026 season with real momentum — the 2025 World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Toronto Blue Jays was a certified hit. The final game of the series was the most-watched World Series game in eight years in the US, and it broke international viewership records. The enthusiasm spilled into social media: Bluesky later reported that on the day of Game 7, at least 3 percent of all posts on the platform were about baseball. TikTok and MLB jointly have said that baseball is “one of the fastest-growing sports communities” on the platform. The league said that its own social media accounts across platforms like Facebook, X, and Instagram had record views and engagement during the series. Even with a pitch clock and automated ball and strike challenges, baseball is a slow, routine game. Teams play every day, and there’s no big event with a Bad Bunny performance to bookend the season. Some have complained that MLB is bad at marketing its stars, failing to make them into household names (when MLB rolled out a program providing players with social content in 2019, even some players said it felt late). Can MLB turn the hard-won attention into something sustainable? Spring training just kicked off, and with it, a flurry of announcements — mostly notably that MLB was partnering with TikTok to bring more baseball-related content and features to the platform. The idea is that TikTok would be a “second screen” for baseball fans to follow along or watch highlights of games. The most interesting thing to me is a shift in social media strategy for MLB. As part of the TikTok partnership, MLB is giving some content creators access to the league’s archives, presumably so it’s easier for people to make breakdowns, fan edits, or whatever else without getting copyright strikes or scrounging for footage. Back in the fall after the World Series, I wrote that if MLB really wants to speak directly to new potential fans, they should just hand over the keys to the creators already making fandom-focused baseball content (Lionsgate did this while promoting its movies last year). We’re not quite at that point yet, but this feels like a step in that direction. For the last few years, MLB clearly has been using online fandom tactics to build buzz and juice engagement on social. Some of MLB’s own social content feels indistinguishable from what a fan account might post — and the league and teams are making the most of the unfettered access they have to players. “I’m passing the phone to Big Dumper,” a slightly distressed-looking Shohei Ohtani, pitcher and designated hitter on the Dodgers, says in a recent clip shared to MLB’s Instagram account (more on Big Dumper aka Cal Raleigh here ). The San Diego Padres made players pose for photos based on Lin-Manuel Miranda memes . There’s a running joke about the admins (read: social media teams) running various team and league accounts: here’s MLB posting from Blackpink and Jonas Brothers concerts , the Chicago Cubs account posting from the crowd at a game , and the Detroit Tigers account asking players what they got for the admin’s birthday . The MLB also realized that fan content pointing back to its players, games, and teams is undeniably helpful even if the league itself didn’t have control over it. Gone are the days of hitting Jomboy with copyright claims — last summer, MLB announced it had acquired a minority stake in Jimmy (“Jomboy”) O’Brien’s media company that pumps out viral breakdowns of game moments and other content. “We are looking forward to bringing baseball fans more entertaining content to help further expand baseball’s online presence and deeper the connection between our sport and its fans,” the league said at the time. Well, yes! Individual players like Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts are also trying to expand their reach to new audiences — Betts hosts his own podcast, called On Base , where he interviews other players. Betts’ attempts to market himself to younger crowds has been at times sloppy, to say the least, like when he joined manosphere-adjacent right wing streamer Adin Ross (you may recognize the name: Ross also hosted the Los Angeles Rams’ Puka Nacua , an appearance Nacua eventually apologized for). It’s a move that speaks to how thirsty people (even millionaire pro athletes) are for a slice of the online audience. The World Baseball Classic — where professional players play for their home countries — starts next week, the first time since 2023 the event is being held. The last series’ USA vs. Japan game broke viewership numbers , but we’ll see if interest has grown since then, now that Shohei Ohtani is two-time World Series champ. Another thing to watch: special themed nights at ballparks, and I’m not just talking about player bobbleheads. A personal favorite is the Hello Kitty nights that teams do (including exclusive Hello Kitty baseball merch ). For the last two years, the Dodgers dedicated a game to vtubers — virtual streamers played by humans behind the scenes — in an effort to tap into other fandoms and collectors and create hype. A One Piece trading card given out at a special themed Dodgers game last summer sold for $14,999.99 . The thing about relying on social media to reach people is that it’s cheap for the audience — it costs nothing for a potential fan to watch players goof off or be subjected to viral TikTok trends. It’s much more expensive to subscribe to a bunch of streaming platforms to watch actual games, and even pricier to attend in person. The metrics for the World Series last year are a bright spot for MLB, but it can’t be a Blue Jays/Dodgers matchup every year. Players move around, get injured, and go through slumps. The stars will eventually retire. MLB’s challenge will not just be marketing the game as it is now, but figuring out how to make it a part of broader culture — and people’s lives — in the coming decades. Of course, all of this is hurtling toward December, when the collective bargaining agreement expires between the MLB Players Association and the league. Perhaps the biggest issue in negotiations will be “competitive balance,” essentially the idea that big market teams with money to burn can simply buy their way to championships. Team owners may push for a salary cap on players, and the fear is that stalled negotiations could lead to a lockout, which in turn could mean losing regular season games. No baseball at all seems like a good way to torch any excitement MLB has built up. It could be its own issue of The Stepback, but MLB, like other sports, is deep in the sludge of sportsbetting. Two pitchers on the Cleveland Guardians are accused of working with bettors and rigging pitches during games. The MLB announced last fall it was placing new limits on bets on pitches. It’s not just baseball that wants to attract new kinds of fans. The NFL has been trying to court women via social media content and partnerships with women’s media brands. Netflix acquired the rights to several high-profile events: a game on opening night in March, the Home Run Derby, and this year, the Field of Dreams game that’s based off the 1989 film and takes place on the set field in Iowa. It’s part of a larger push by Netflix into live programming . Lina Khan agrees with you : Food at baseball stadiums is too expensive.

This New Yorker piece on just how spectacular Ohtani really is. This piece by my colleague Kevin Nguyen about similar automation technology being used in tennis. And when the 2026 season is over, come back to this wistful, iconic essay by A. Bartlett Giamatti, former MLB commissioner (and actor Paul Giamatti’s father) about baseball and the passage of time.

A dangerously mercurial president, the blatant profiteering and corporate give-and-take, the expansive use of government surveillance, a supine Fourth Estate owned by billionaires, the rampant tyranny of ICE: These are the best preconditions to introduce Name Tag, brought to you by Meta and Ray-Ban. After months and months of ceaseless whining about the doxxing of ICE agents , there hasn’t been a single peep from Attorney General Pam Bondi about the future of facial recognition in Meta glasses. If frictionless facial recognition becomes commonplace, theoretically, ICE is vulnerable to the technology as well. But the government is remarkably complacent on this front. Maybe it thinks that Meta is at the beck and call of Washington, DC, and will change its product to suit the needs of ICE. Maybe the screaming over “doxxing” was never actually about doxxing. Or maybe a little bit of both? As The Verge ’s Victoria Song notes , even though smart glasses “aren’t inherently evil,” the Ray-Bans are automatically suspicious due to Meta’s established history of carelessness and ongoing demonstration of its totally demagnetized moral compass. Meta knows that the glasses are controversial, and that combining them with facial recognition poses serious privacy risks. But the time is ripe to spring the combination on a distracted, jaded public. According to an internal memo from last year, reviewed by The New York Times , the company claimed the feature will be launched “during a dynamic political environment where many civil society groups that we would expect to attack us would have their resources focused on other concerns.” The sentence is remarkably self-serving, even for Meta. The “dynamic political environment,” one presumes, is the chaotic Trump administration, the very same regime with which Meta and its CEO has curried favor — using slobbering praise and ideologically motivated policy changes and ballroom donations that went toward demolishing the historic White House East Wing . The “civil society groups” would be any of the civil liberties organizations, such as the ACLU, that take an interest in privacy rights; the “other concerns” distracting them would be the rampant surveillance and repression of Americans by the aforementioned “dynamic political environment.” Lina Khan’s FTC would have probably had something to say about it; the newspapers would have had a field day in an era before The Washington Post was bought and sold for parts by a Trump-enamored Jeff Bezos. But this is a new world, and the ascendance of fascism can really pave the way for a product launch! The ascendance of fascism can really pave the way for a product launch! The social violation posed by Meta’s glasses is unusually stark . The front-facing cameras combined with a smart interface and a low-profile appearance make them harder to clock. The ease of surveillance combined with additional computing features, all bundled inside a wearable that isn’t immediately detectable as a recording device, makes for a novel kind of a wiretap. This is not tricky to understand, the way that NSA bulk collection of metadata might be. A judge will grasp in an instant the danger these devices pose to the sanctity of jury proceedings; internet commenters instinctively despise their use in public spaces like the New York City subway . Just because you are outside of your home doesn’t mean you have consented to having a random bozo collect your face and your name, the latter of which can enable them to search for your digital presence or even home address. The act of existing in public should not carry those risks. You do not want Name Tag to haunt you just outside the synagogue, gay bar, or abortion clinic. Americans’ increasing addiction to filming each other adversarially is a symptom of the erosion of trust in our society; we broadcast each other breaching social norms , and we record law enforcement breaking the law . The institutions that are supposed to solve collective action problems have been hijacked or subverted. The forces that are supposed to keep the peace and curb violence instead sow discord and dole out death . Hostility is the basic mode in which we engage with each other and our government, and filming has become a hostile act. Meta’s glasses are a sleek version of the weapon everyone already has in their pocket; the addition of facial recognition will accelerate the ongoing breakdown in public trust. We are no longer operating in a world where we judge technology by what would happen if it landed in the ‘wrong hands.’ It is already in the wrong hands. The notion that any individual creep can get their hands on these glasses should be chilling: Even a mildly antisocial personality can wreak serious harm with the technology. But ultimately, it is not the regular old stalker who poses the greatest threat when it comes to Meta’s Ray-Bans. Fundamentally, the glasses are collecting data about the whereabouts of other people all over the world while calling back home to computers owned by a corporation with a track record of collecting far too much information about its users and being far too permissive about what others do with it . As with all data collected by third-party corporations, it is highly vulnerable to subpoenas by the government, which is presently engaged in an expansive war on unmasking its critics on the internet . How will Meta safeguard that data, when it wouldn’t even safeguard its fact-checking program in the face of a White House that is hostile toward facts? We are no longer operating in a world where we judge technology by what would happen if it landed in the “wrong hands.” It is already in the wrong hands. Industry and government have been captured by the worst people you know. The federal government of the United States is run by white supremacists who believe in the “ great replacement” theory , and is currently engaged in a project of forced demographic change through mass deportation enabled by racial profiling blessed by the Supreme Court and enacted by an agency flush with billions of dollars . To be blunt, the work of ICE is the work of ethnic cleansing. And all centralized repositories of data that connect the identities and real-life locations of individuals, if exposed to ICE, will become tools of ethnic cleansing. Even without a formal relationship — that we know of, anyway — some feds have embraced the glasses: A Customs and Border Protection agent was photographed last year wearing Meta glasses at an immigration raid. Tech is never neutral; it is owned, created, and maintained by people with specific points of view, priorities, and vested political interests. The benefits it bestows on the powerful and the powerless are not equal or proportionate. As with the removal of the ICEBlock app from Apple’s App Store, Silicon Valley is at the beck and call of Washington, DC. Meta will tweak and adjust the rollout of Name Tag to best appease the “dynamic political environment” that made the launch possible in the first place. Bondi knows the score, and so do the rest of us. Surveillance is their tool, not ours, and Meta belongs to them, and not to us.

      "content_text": "For the third year running , Honor has announced what it says is the world’s thinnest book-style folding phone. For the second year , it’s combined that with the biggest battery in any foldable too. This year, for its third and final trick, the company went ahead and made sure it was the first foldable with an IP69 rating too. The Honor Magic V6 was announced at MWC in Barcelona today, though Honor has played a bit fast and loose with timing to guarantee those three records: the V6 won’t go on sale in China until some time later this month, and the international release is still months away, in the second half of the year, so Honor isn’t saying anything yet about pricing. Still, I’ve had a sample of the phone for a few weeks, so its big claims aren’t all hypothetical. Last year Google proved its hardware chops with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold , the first foldable with an IP68 rating, meaning the maximum rating for dust protection and a near-top rating for water. Honor has one-upped Google with the Magic V6, which boasts both IP68 and IP69 ratings, meaning it’s rated for both immersion in water and exposure to high-pressure and high-temperature water jets. So now you can fold in both the bath and the shower, not to mention the inside of an industrial carwash. Closed, this is the thinnest book-style foldable around. The USB-C port is essentially the limiting factor now. This gold version isn’t actually the thinnest, but I do like it’s shimmering finish. The camera is still big, but it sticks out from the body less than before. The V6 measures 4mm thick when open, and 8.75mm when folded shut (well, the white version does — other colors are fractionally thicker). That’s the same as an iPhone 17 Pro Max , and thinner than previous foldables, but barely: it’s 0.15mm slimmer than Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 7 , and only 0.05mm thinner than last year’s Magic V5, though Honor has slimmed its bulky camera module down a touch too. We’re deep into hair-splitting territory now, but it still remains delightful that a foldable can feel as thin as a standard slab smartphone. More impressive is the battery. The Magic V6 has a huge 6,660mAh battery, up from 5,820mAh in the V5, and a full 50 percent larger than the Z Fold 7’s 4,400mAh. I haven’t spent enough time testing the phone to have a good sense of how long that battery lasts in practice, which I’ll save for a full review closer to when it actually goes on sale, but even with two screens I’d expect it to breeze through the day and then some. The big battery was my favorite part of the Magic V5 , and now Honor has pushed it even further. You might have guessed by now that Honor’s achieved the trick by using a silicon-carbon battery. This year it’s bumped the silicon content up from 15 to 25 percent, which has allowed it to make the battery even more energy-dense than before. The company claims to have developed a 32 percent silicon battery too, which will be exclusively available in the 1TB version of the V6 in China — Honor won’t yet say how big that battery will be, but it’ll apparently break the 7,000mAh line. Honor says the crease is reduced, but it’s not gone yet. The company is bullish about the telephoto lens, but how good it really is remains to be seen. Other specs are typically high-end: a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 , 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, stylus support on both screens, 80W wired charging, and wireless charging too — though not magnetic Qi2. The triple rear camera includes a 64-megapixel, 3x periscope that Honor claimed in a press briefing is “the best telephoto in a foldable.” I can’t give that a fair test yet since my sample phone is still on pre-release camera software, but I’d be surprised if it can beat the telephotos on Vivo’s recent foldables. The Magic V6 has one more trick up its sleeve: Honor has leaned further into its efforts to build cross-compatibility with Apple devices. The Magic V6 will apparently be able to support the full software feature set of AirPods, even including Find My tracking (though, oddly, it will not support any other Find My devices). That’s in addition to the ability to sync notifications to an iPhone, send them to an Apple Watch, and share screens and files with iPhones or MacBooks. Honor didn’t confirm to me if it has plans to join Google in supporting AirDrop , but you have to imagine it’s in the works. The V6 may not be quite as outlandish as Honor’s gimbal-equipped Robot Phone, also shown off at MWC. Each of its three records would feel quite minor in isolation, but hopefully they add up to a meaningful upgrade. We’ll find out for sure when the phone actually launches later this year.

      "content_text": "While my love of smoked meats is well-documented, my own journey into actually tending the fire started just last spring when I jumped at the opportunity to review the Traeger Woodridge Pro . When Recteq came calling with a similar offer to check out the Flagship 1600, I figured it would be a good way to stay warm all winter. While the two smokers have a lot in common, the Recteq definitely feels like an upgrade from the Traeger I’ve been using. Not only does it have nearly twice the cooking space, but the huge pellet hopper, rounded barrel, and proper smokestack help me feel like a real pitmaster. The trade-off is losing some of the usability features that make the Woodridge Pro a great first smoker. The setup isn’t as quite as simple, and the larger footprint and less ergonomic conditions require a little more experience or patience. With both options, excellent smoked meat is just a few button presses away, but speaking as someone with both in their backyard, I’ve been firing up the Recteq more often. Getting Settled Photograph: Brad Bourque Setting up the Recteq wasn’t as time-consuming as the Woodridge, but it was more difficult to manage on my own. Some of the steps, like attaching the bull horns to the lid, or flipping the barrel onto its stand, would really benefit from a patient friend or loved one. Like most smokers, you’ll need to run a burn-in cycle at 400 degrees Fahrenheit to make sure there’s nothing left over from manufacturing or shipping. Given the amount of setup time and need to cool down the smoker after, I would recommend setting this up Friday afternoon if you want to smoke on a Saturday.",

      "summary": "Some creatures can dramatically alter their internal temperature and outlast storms, floods and, predators",
      "content_text": "In 1774, British physician-scientist Charles Blagden received an unusual invitation from a fellow physician: to spend time in a small room that was hotter, he wrote, “than it was formerly thought any living creature could bear.” Many people may have been appalled by this offer, but Blagden was delighted by the opportunity for self-experimentation. He marveled as his own temperature remained at 98° Fahrenheit (approximately 37° Celsius), even as the temperature of the room approached 200°F (about 93°C). Today, this ability to maintain a stable body temperature—called homeothermy—is known to exist among myriad species of mammals and birds. But there are also some notable exceptions. The body temperature of the fat-tailed dwarf lemur, for example, can fluctuate by nearly 45°F (25°C) over a single day. In fact, a growing body of research suggests that many more animals than scientists once appreciated employ this flexible approach—heterothermy—varying their body temperature for minutes, hours, or weeks at a time. This may help the animals to persist through all sorts of dangers. “Because we’re homeotherms, we assume all mammals work the way we do,” says Danielle Levesque , a mammalian ecophysiologist at the University of Maine. But in recent years, as improvements in technology allowed researchers to more easily track small animals and their metabolisms in the wild, “we’re starting to find a lot more weirdness,” she says. The most extreme—and well-known—form of heterothermy is classic hibernation , which has been most extensively studied in critters who use it to save energy and so survive the long, cold winters of the Northern Hemisphere. These animals enter long periods of what scientists call deep torpor, when metabolism slows to a crawl and body temperature can drop to just above freezing. But hibernation is just one end of what some scientists now consider a spectrum. Many mammals can deploy shorter bouts of shallow torpor—loosely defined as smaller reductions in metabolism and smaller fluctuations in body temperature—as the need arises, suggesting that torpor has more functions than scientists previously realized.",

      "content_text": "There’s also the risk that footage falls into the wrong hands and ends up enabling politically-motivated investigations, police harassment, or stalking without you intending or even knowing about it. Maybe company employees or third-party contractors gain access to videos, or your cameras are hacked. Amazon settled a privacy lawsuit brought by the FTC that mentioned both scenarios a few years ago. More recently, ICE has been tapping into Flock's automatic license plate reader (ALPR) cameras across the US, according to 404 media . What might it do with access to video doorbells? Then there are doorbell owners. Camera footage is frequently shared online without the knowledge or permission of the subject. People on neighborhood networking apps and social media groups post videos of supposedly suspicious characters. Unfortunately, these suspicions are often subject to their prejudices, and racial profiling can be a real problem, as this research suggests. But, provided footage is captured in a public place, it’s perfectly legal to share it . “Recording into windows, fenced backyards, or other private spaces on your property may be an invasion of privacy,” Emile Ayoub , senior counsel in the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program, explained to WIRED. “But footage that captures public-facing sidewalks or driveways likely won’t have the same protection.” So, What Are Your Rights? The law is straightforward when it comes to the police. “Unless presented with an official request via a warrant or other court order, users are not required to share their footage with law enforcement,\" says Ayoub. ”Certain providers allow law enforcement to post on community message boards seeking footage from users. You can ignore or decline those requests.\" If your video footage is stored in the cloud, rather than on your device, law enforcement can compel companies to hand it over, he explained. Typically, law enforcement must obtain a warrant or similar court order, depending on the type of information they seek. But there are exceptions to the warrant requirement in the case of emergencies, such as an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury. According to their privacy policies, providers like Ring and Nest will notify users about data demands from law enforcement, unless they are prohibited by law from doing so. Of course, no one reads the privacy policy before they set a doorbell up. “This is one of the scariest things about the rapid privatization of police surveillance,” says the EFF’s Dr. Guariglia. “As more evidence begins its journey as corporate data, the public has less and less power to figure out what happens to your information inside the company, if they require a warrant, what their relationship is like with police, and whether your data has been turned over.” How to Safeguard Your Video Doorbell Footage There may be a $10K bounty awaiting anyone who can hack Ring cameras to stop sharing data with Amazon , but there are easier and quicker ways to safeguard your video doorbell footage. Getting rid of your doorbell altogether is the simplest way to put privacy concerns to bed, but if you find them useful, you could always just avoid cloud services. “Own your data,” says Matt Sailor, founder of global digital surveillance manufacturer IC Realtime . “There's no need for other people to have your data.”",

Laser printers have a few advantages over inkjet printers, the biggest of which is speed. Because thereâ€™s no ink to dry, laser printers generally print much faster. They also tend to be more cost effective, with toner cartridges costing more than ink cartridges up front, but printing more pages, although Iâ€™ve generally found ink tank printers even more economical if thatâ€™s your main concern. The biggest downside to laser printers is typically a lower level of detail, particularly when mixing colors, so youâ€™ll want to opt for something else if you plan on printing full color photos. Because they use heat to bond the toner with the paper, they may melt paper with plastic in it, like windowed envelopes or sticker sheets, so youâ€™ll want to avoid them if anything but matte paper and cardstock are in the cards for you. While I spent time with all of the printers below and found them satisfactory, I would still push most home users towards an ink tank printer. Youâ€™ll have a lower cost per page, lower upfront costs, and the option to print crisp photos and on alternative papers.
